I'm more of an outsider, still get along, but not as close friends as some of the rest.

This past season, during week 15 and 16, several of the eliminated teams, as usual, continued to participate even though they had no more matchups, picking up players and using waivers to block, interfere, affect, and generally trying to help their closer friends. Several of these moves blocked me and prevented me from picking up some major pickups down the stretch that would've helped me (team defenses, lynn bowdens, salvon achmeds, just examples etc...). Instead they were picked up by eliminated teams intentionally to thwart my chances, help their closer friend, and I felt generally screwed over.

Is this generally normal in fantasy football for these interpersonal relationships to come into play down the stretch and for people to use their waivers even though they are completely eliminated from contention?? I've since asked the commissioner if he thought it would be reasonable to lock the teams out of contention---and he hasn't replied at all. I think the league insists on allowing this because they like to be able to interfere and support their closer friends and prevent others (such as myself) from winning the pot.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I have a decent case to lock the rosters/remove losers bracket? Or does this come across as sour grapes by me? Basically, just need to know if this type of conflict of interest is par for the course in fantasy football?",fantasyfootball,0,1610647487,kxb0g8,1

66,A way to measure league strength,phoenix9797,"I was running some numbers for our league this afternoon, and I think I found something interesting.  At least: I'd like to propose something here so that others can contribute their interpretations.  

What I did first was compute our league's season-long weekly scoring average, which turned out to be around 160.  (The precise values aren't important here, because they will obviously vary according to your league's scoring system.)  

What I did next was compute the ""default"" average score by generating an ""default"" lineup composed of the average RB1, the average RB2, etc.  This meant that I sorted players by total season-long points, took (for example) the top 12 RBs (because we're a 12-team league), averaged those total points, divided by 16 (to get a per-game number for the ""average"" RB1), and put that number in the ""average"" lineup as the RB1.  Then for RB2, I took season-long RBs 13-24, got their season-long average, divided by 16, and put that number at RB2.  And so on down the line, for each lineup position.

In our league, the ""default"" lineup scored about 1.5 points per week *more* than our actual league-average score.  After thinking about it, my conclusion is that this could be a way to measure your league's overall strength in terms of competitiveness.  If your league scored significantly more (on average) than the ""default"" lineup, that signals to me that your league has very good players who correctly choose matchups accurately (thereby boosting the league average score higher than the ""default"" average score).  If your league scored significantly less than the ""default"" lineup, then your league's members aren't as astute (overall) at playing the optimal weekly matchups.

I find this interesting, because although it's a bit of a pain to compute, it would actually settle the ""can I play in your league so I can own you, bro, hur, hur"" type-comments that I see around here a ton during the season.  

In other words, you could actually check to see how competitive your league is, by running this calculation.

93,A look at the QBs this year based on ADP. fantasy points and Top 12 finishes from my perspective.,TheFFnerd,"The fantasy season has come to a close. I was pretty happy sealing up two championships, finishing in third in one, and did not make the finals in either the dynasty Important Nonsense league or my first best ball league with IN. I also did a fantasy league with fans trying a different scoring format to see how I would do. I found out not well, as one of the fans did fantastically. After having almost 20 leagues last year, I felt like I could not give enough attention to each league to have success. This year, I kept it to six leagues. Looking back on the year, I did a decent job streaming Quarterback in the one league where I could. I struggled in the fan league because everyone had two QBs rostered. In the dynasty league, it is impossible to stream QBs. 

https://preview.redd.it/40ylkz5w8za61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd0e7ffce85252d0fc6da9521e4e4d5035dc63f

There is a minimum of 10 games to limit the two significant outliers that would have been at the top. Dak Prescott led all QBs in points per game with 27.73 fantasy points, but only played five games and had a season-ending injury. The second QB is Marcus Mariota, who came in against the Chargers when Derek Carr went out with a groin injury. He averaged 26.84 fantasy points. 

Being the fantasy manager that I am, if you couldn't tell, I love to stream QB, Defenses, Tight Ends, and Kickers. My core players always remain consistent around my running backs and wide receivers. Filling out my roster's entirety, I wait until the last few rounds to pick up QB, TE, D, and K. I may be looking to grab Kelce, Kittle, Andrews, or Waller next year. But let's get back to the QB. Every year, one of my favorite stats is the number of Quarterbacks that top 12 weeks. This year was no different. 

https://preview.redd.it/8rdtxhr39za61.jpg?width=874&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c95834c279c6672ef4be8e83c87ba0e41a6fd96

Aaron Rodgers had the most top 12 finishes. Including these QBs, 38 different quarterbacks were finishing at least once in the top 12. However, I took out players who did not play at least ten games, and doing so lowers the top 12 finishes to 35. One of the names that shocked me the most was Cam Newton (seven weeks in the top 12 or 46.6%) and Kirk Cousins (eight weeks in the top 12 - 50%). Two that are not quite as surprising are Justin Herbert, who once he got the job had nine top 12 weeks (60%), and Ryan Tannehill, who had eight top 12 weeks (50%). Only two other QBs had more than five weeks with Top 12 finishes in Matt Ryan (6 or 37.5%) and Derek Carr (6 or 37.5%). All others had five or less. 

https://preview.redd.it/asnki7h19za61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=202dd8351e99d6b6ace12ab6c9256f63b22e05f3

Some random spot starts could have been streamed. These players include Brandon Allen, who had 1 Top 12 finish in 5 starts or 25%. There was also Taysom Hill‚Äôs anomaly who technically started every game but only played five weeks at QB. Hill put up 4 top 12 finishes for an 80% top 12 in those five weeks. This all shows how one can wait for Quarterback in drafts and have a lot of success.

https://preview.redd.it/r7zscd7n9za61.jpg?width=941&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9140909febe85ff7014e1cb075df7c92affe40f5

There are a few ‚Äúdead‚Äù areas in the draft that can be useful to grab QBs, like rounds five and eight. Both rounds seemed to have a lot of success when drafting QBs this year. I hope this makes you realize that drafting a quarterback isn't worth it. Granted, my definition of early being the top 4 rounds (filling out the more critical positions - RB and WR).

5,Dynasty Value of Derrick Henry?,johnr2020,"Derrick Henry will likely be a top 3 fantasy running back in everyone‚Äôs preseason rankings next year. He has arguably the highest floor of any RB in football and barring injury, should produce in similar ways to what he‚Äôs done the past 2 seasons.

However, in dynasty formats, is this not the perfect time to try and pivot from Henry?

Henry is 27 years old and has eclipsed 300 carries in back to back seasons, including a whopping 378 carries this season. Henry is a physical monster and there are not too many direct comparisons as to how he might age. There are some examples of physical runners who did age nicely into their early 30‚Äôs. 

Adrian Peterson‚Äôs 27 year old season saw him go for 2000 yards. His 28 year old year, he rushed for 1200 yards and 10 TD‚Äôs. 

Marshawn Lynch had 2 of his best seasons in his 27 and 28 year old seasons.

Coming off 2 monster seasons with historic volume in regards to this 2-back era, his value may never be higher. While there‚Äôs data to support Henry should maintain his RB1 production for at least 1-2 more years, it‚Äôs always better to be a year ahead with a running back than holding them until their value runs dry.

Specifically I have the 3rd pick in the draft and a lot of people are wanting my pick for one of their players. Would me trading my first rounder for Prescott be worth it? What kind of players could I get for that pick?

38,How not to gamble your life away this Playoff Season/CFB final,dicktuneup,"I love football and ‚Äòtis the season for partaking in fun contests with our friends and family - maybe even getting a little action on a favorable line you‚Äôre seeing. This is your friendly reminder to check in with yourself and make sure you‚Äôre betting for the right reasons - with your heart and your mind, not compulsively. 

My advice that I have been using during contests - especially big games/during parlays...
Before you start to hedge, or pick up another live bet - take 3 deep breaths, ask yourself the following questions:
- How am I feeling emotionallh? 
- What is this emotion trying to tell me? 
- How can I operate at my highest level of understanding? 

These questions won‚Äôt change your luck; but they may stop you from getting in your own way (my ultimate weakness). If you‚Äôre not seeing with strong clarity - don‚Äôt play. As a recovering stimulation addict, I found myself displacing my addictions from sexting, to porn, to social media. I started my own subreddit r/stimulationaddiction because I detoxed from my addictions and wanted to stay up on my compulsions and live more deliberately. 

One of my favorite aspects of sports betting is how it pulls you into the present - deeply passionate about the outcome of the game, often in the same way the players are. My goal is to be able to tap into that feeling naturally (so I am not only betting to get it, to mainly bet with friends in small contests, and to keep my bets deliberate (never chase and don‚Äôt spend me life seeking the right line) - so that I can get the optimal outcome but also so that I can bet in a healthy way. Once gambling become compulsive - a reaction rather than a choice, you know you have a problem for your health, and will for your wallet. 

Stay connected to your feelings, stay grounded. Enjoy yourselves and may the odds be in your favor!",fantasyfootball,1,1610396424,kvb3yg,1

50,How would you rank the sophomore RBs next season?,JesusChristSupers1ar,"I might miss one or two, but the key players are as follows (no particular order):

* JRob
* Swift
* Gibson
* Taylor
* CEH
* Dobbins

I wouldn't really consider Moss in this group but I'm open if youw ant to include them

personally my rankings are:

1. JRob - he was the only bellcow of this group and looked very good. Assuming the Jags don't bring in any other RB competition, the offense will be opened up and he'll get better opportunities


2. Dobbins - don't think Ingram will be on the team next season and Dobbins looked very good down the stretch. The nature of the team's offense with Jackson makes RBs very valuable. Dobbins will likely still split time with Gus but I think Dobbins will end up with the most carries

3. Gibson - after watching this season I think Gibson is the most talented. There's some question marks about who the QB will be but I think he'll end up with the most work in the backfield

4. Akers - he emerged later in the season but I still don't know how much I trust McVay will give Akers work vs Brown and HEnderson. He'll probably end up as the lead but I think it'll ultimately be a timeshare

5. CEH - I can't imagine next year will be much different than this year; possibly worse with the other D Williams coming back. Chiefs are a pass first team so RB touches are limited and Reid showed he didn't really trust CEH in a bellcow role

6. Swift - even if Swift takes over the backfield next year (I don't think that'll happen anyway), that offense is gonna _suck_. Stafford likely won't be on the team and neither will Golladay which puts them in a really bad place. Swift might get a lot of touches but they'll be low quality

obviously a lot of this stuff might change based on offseason moves but think it's interesting to talk about now regardless",fantasyfootball,1,1610377746,kv4g0u,1

Everyone is going to remember his first 8-10 weeks to the season, and see his stats weren‚Äôt all that great, but him and Lamar have really found a rhythm with one another down the stretch. Many thought this dude was gonna be great this year as it is, but after his initial sophomore slump, he‚Äôs really been playing well.

86,New App - RancUp Beta Full Recap (Plus One Last Giveaway from the 2020 Season),NotFromSaidCountry,"Hey everyone, Marcus with RancUp here.  A little over 10 weeks ago, we released the New App, [RancUp](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/jj8tak/after_years_of_seeing_posts_dedicated_to_rankings/), for Beta.  With it seeming like the experts are always wrong in their predictions, we created the App to let everyone set their own rankings, and see who the most accurate is.   With the 10 week Beta finished up, we wanted to provide a post recapping the progress / thanking everyone who‚Äôs helped out / provide some possible details for the 2021 Season.


#Competition

Though we haven‚Äôt gotten around to creating the public site / public app, we wanted to release the app for Beta to test out the accuracy of the rankings / functionality and see how player information was updating.  To add a bit extra to the competition, we put up a potential $3,000+ that could have been won that included prizes for the most accurate each week, the most accurate across streaks of multiple weeks, perfect rankings for the position of the week, and side challenge ideas we threw in every now and then.


#Winners

With all the different opportunities, here were some of the winners

1.	u/notfromsaidcountry / [MarcusVoran](https://twitter.com/TheRealRancUp) - $1,150

2.	u/sportsedge / [The DTM Squatch](https://twitter.com/DanLeach971) - $700

3.	[ZackMarklevitz](https://twitter.com/zackmarklevitz) - $100

4.	[NickBuck](https://twitter.com/nckbuck) - $100

5.	u/Kess013 - $100

6.	u/clunas7 - $50

7.	u/PeakedInHighSkool - $50 (who donated his winnings to u/BeerSheets charity for [FRC Team 3650](https://twitter.com/TheRealRancUp/status/1344266530889101312))


#Side Challenges

I‚Äôd like to extended a thank you to all the volunteers / participants on the side challenges we did in Week 16 and Week 17.

Week 16 ‚Äì [Reddit vs Radio Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kixypb/fantasy_rankings_reddit_vs_radio_team_reddit/) which was [won by Team Reddit], had the following team members (u/clunas7 and u/PeakedInHighSkool).  Though that challenge only allowed for 2 teammates, u/PhoecesBrown and u/Sgt-GiggleFarts volunteered for Team Reddit as well (I hope to be able to do more like this next season).

Week 17 ‚Äì [NFC North Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kp2n3n/fantasy_rankings_nfc_north_challenge_looking_for/) which was [won by Team Lions](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kn65l5/fantasy_rankings_reddit_vs_radio_challenge/), had the following team members (u/sportsedge and u/Riger1984).  Team Vikings had u/jakefromst8farm_ and u/banabanabban and Team Packers had u/Xeosphere volunteer


#Feedback

Though there‚Äôs areas we know we want to add some improvements, we‚Äôve been getting some great feedback from all of you.  Wanted to give a shoutout to u/summit462, u/ffcruz, u/AshevilleTerp, u/evantom34, and u/5WideFantasy

Also, the response we got in the post regarding the [voting on potential future features](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kb8e7p/we_released_the_new_app_rancup_for_beta_a_few/) was great.  This really helps us get an idea of what you all want to sere for next season üòä 


#2020 Season Giveaway

Since [Team Lions won the $100 NFC North Challenge](https://twitter.com/TheRealRancUp/status/1346235189895323650), the team members, [Riger](https://twitter.com/riger1984) and [Leach](https://twitter.com/DanLeach971), decided they wanted to pay their winnings forward, and do a Giveaway.  If you want to participate in that, [click here for details.](https://twitter.com/TheRealRancUp/status/1348322859718995968)


#2021 Season

We‚Äôre going to do our best to improve on what‚Äôs already available, and try and make the app even better next year.

Some have asked if we‚Äôd be able to do some prizes again next year.  Can‚Äôt make any promises yet, but that‚Äôs the goal.

I hope to be able to do more posts discussing [My Rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kjjoir/my_rankings_all_positions_week_16/) along with showcasing others in the [Featured Rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kkk50x/week_16_featured_rankings_all_positions_team/).... Haha, questions on those posts come in crazy fast.

With the season being over, there isn‚Äôt anything to rank for 2021 yet.  You can still download the app to get updates as new features get implemented, see ranking results from last season, and get started on 2021 rankings once they become available.  If you haven‚Äôt yet, [you can click here for details on how to download the beta app.](https://twitter.com/TheRealRancUp/status/1321562896313274368)

Thank you so much!  We hope you all have a great offseason and look forward to getting 2021 setup soon!!",fantasyfootball,1,1610300652,kuj03w,1

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you‚Äôre thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he‚Äôs been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn‚Äôt work out for you, don‚Äôt come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.  We always have and will continue to enforce lengthy bans for this sort of gloating or harassment, so don‚Äôt do it!

QB, RB, WR, TE, Red Zone Passes, Red Zone Rushes, and Red Zone Receptions. In each category, we have how many Fantasy Points Per Game the defense has given up, who their opponent is, and how many fantasy points per game the team has accrued so far in 2020. Along with that, we have every stat you need to find the perfect match-ups this weekend.

We've moved this back over to Google Sheets with a link above so you can open it on a webpage. There is literally no way to optimize this for mobile due to the fact of how many columns/stats are there. It's best to view it on a computer.

65,What is some advice you can give about players on your favorite team?,someguy_358,"I feel like people know players on their team very well. So I thought it would be pretty cool to get some advice from fans of certain teams

As a seahawks fan here's my advice:

Russell Wilson: he'll win you games and lose you games. Russell usually plays really well at the beginning of the year and regresses as the year goes on. 

Chris carson: ssuming he stays, he's a really safe floor since he gets about 15 carries a game, but he's extremely injury prone. If you draft him, I would recommend that you pick up a handcuff who probably gets a decent amount of touches from this run heavy offense anyway.

Dk Metcalf: Dk is pretty inconsistent as a #1 fantasy WR as of now, but he has a ton of potential in the future. I do believe he has healthy Julio Jones potential.

Tyler Lockett: Lockett is Russell's go to reciever but he gets yards taken away from Metcalf. He's more of a boom or bust for me, but when russ is cooking, so will Lockett.

Defense: this defense has looked pretty good lately, but it could change with kj Wright and shaquill griffins contract expiring. But most of the key players like wagner, reed, dunlap, diggs, and adams are still there.

Thats about it for the hawks. Even advice for one player would help out a lot.",fantasyfootball,1,1610176345,ktm93c,1

67,The ESPN AI League Championships!,pterodaktyl4,"You might be confused on what I mean based off the title, but basically, I had 2 ESPN 10 Team Leagues (one PPR, one Standard), that were ran by ESPN.

Here was the conditions.

* Team 1 had the 1st pick, Team 2 with the 2nd, and it was drafted the day before the opener.
* Draft was an ESPN Automated Draft, no rankings were touched.
* No trades were made.
* Starting Lineups were based off projections (FLEX would be the 3rd highest projected WR/RB)
* Waivers were done by going off the Top 25 Most Added/Dropped.
* Waivers were updated Wednesday and Saturday.
* If more dropped players than added players in the Top 25. Then it would be based off most dropped.
* 1 more added twist on waivers. If multiple players were dropped by the same team on waivers, the lowest team would get dibs on all the players.
* Roster needed to be full, so if no available starting position due to bye or projection of 0.0. They would go to waivers, and add the most added player available / drop the most dropped player on their roster at the time
* Schedules were randomized, so that's why some records are more than others.
* The 6 teams who have been eliminated from playoffs, will not affect the waivers starting this week.

#How It Worked
For those that joined the beta, they could set their own rankings and see how accurate theirs rankings were.  With this everyone was able to compete against everyone else.  This was only available for beta, so you needed an Android or Apple device, then download the Beta and get started setting your own rankings

[Android Beta Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rancup.rancup)

[Apple Beta Link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/6mG1N4Gy)

[Instructional Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnDCLNTzjJw)  


The Beta can still be downloaded, but with the 2020 season over, there isn‚Äôt any functionality at the moment (aside from getting a better look at everyone‚Äôs past rankings to see which were the most accurate).  We will be working toward getting 2021 up and running soon though.

Looking forward to continuing the competitions / the search for the best rankers next season!",fantasyfootball,2,1610145950,ktdt8b,1

89,Montgomery owners and/or bears fans,TempeSunDevil06,"What exactly changed to allow him to break out? Was it just an improved Mitch taking other down the stretch?

I had him in dynasty for most of his first two years and finally decided to package him with another player and move on. I just didn‚Äôt see the upside. Below average to bad oline. Mitch/Foles. He isn‚Äôt that explosive in my opinion, compared to his peers of course. He doesn‚Äôt have great vision. Nagy didn‚Äôt seem like he was doing a good job of calling plays. What the hell was it that changed, and do you think it‚Äôs sustainable next year? 

Long story short, you can thank me for Montgomery‚Äôs break out lol. He had to be freed from the shackles of my team.",fantasyfootball,3,1610144593,ktdcy8,1

96,You Don't Need a Top RB to Win it All,mchnkl,"My championship roster had 0 RBs finish the year inside the top 20 but 3 WRs finish top 10! By going zero RB early in the draft and loading up on high-upside prospects in the mid to late rounds and waiver wire, I was able to cobble together enough quality starts throughout the year with guys like Swift, Edmunds, Akers, McKinnon, and Bernard to stabilize the RB position for a week or two at a time while my early round WRs carried me to the title. Outside of the top 3-4 RBs, you should only draft pass catchers in the first 4 rounds.

Note this strategy is intended for PPR leagues with 4 pt passing TDs and increases in effectiveness as your league's starting roster size increases.",fantasyfootball,3,1610137768,ktb0rq,1
97,Biggest 2020 fantasy season regrets,GTank22,"I know at least some of you have that one terrible trade/drop that lead to you definitely losing a game or 4. I revel in misery at that fact that I dropped Justin Jefferson after week 1 for Paris Campbell and can‚Äôt begin to tell you how much that infuriated me down the road as the season progressed. 

Of course hindsight is 20/20 (there‚Äôs a stupid pun in there with how shit that year was in general) but it still doesn‚Äôt make it any less annoying. Would love to know how painful it was for everybody else.

For the love of God make sure you take Stefon Diggs

Just avoid all bengals next year

Take Terry if he drops but keep in mind he‚Äôs probably dropping for a good, WB based reason

20,Playoff Roster Compare Spreadsheet,Blackknight07,"Hey all,

I made this spreadsheet that lets you compare playoff rosters and thought others might be interested.  It's not super fancy...I know just enough about excel to know I don't know anything about excel, but I hope it's useful to someone.

The week 13-16 data is taken from FP **STANDARD SCORING** and then the averages are multiplied by the TR (Team Rankings) expected wins data to get an estimated score of each player throughout the playoffs.  Feel free to mess around with that if you think teams will go farther/shorter.

Never done anything like this before, so let me know what you guys think!

1 qb 
2 wr 
1 rb 
1 te
1 k

What‚Äôs a typical strategy? Seems pretty obvious I know you want to get players that you think will make the run. Target qb first ?

ESPN is not perfect but it can be improved. Sleeper has better settings available but we can work with both. 

**Sleeper**, my preferred, I propose: 

-	0 points per FG made 
-	0.1 points per FG yard
-	1 point PAT made
-	0 points per FG missed
-	-1 point per FG missed from 0-49 yards
-	0 points per FG missed 50+
-	-1 point per PAT missed


**ESPN**, I propose: 

-	1 point per PAT made
-	-1 point per PAT missed
-	3 points FG made 0-39 yards
-	4 points FG made 40-49 yards
-	5 points FG made 50-59 yards
-	6 points FG made 60+ yards
-	-1 point FG missed 0-39 yards
-	-1 point FG missed 40-49 yards

The problem with ESPN is the point per FG yard which makes scoring a little difficult. A 20 yard FG make should not be as valuable as a 39 yard FG because one is at the 3 yard line and the other is outside the red zone. ESPN also defaults to a missed PAT at 0 which seems to be leftover from before they changed the PAT yardage. A missed FG 50+ yard should not be penalized IMO since some are just last chance end of half 58 yarders. 

Any thoughts or tweaks to the scoring?",fantasyfootball,0,1610121818,kt5dnm,1

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team‚Äôs matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you‚Äôre in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‚ÄòEm game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

**Please do not post screenshots of your matchups.**

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn‚Äôt give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

72,A quick note on Zeke,StrachNasty,"Zeke has fallen out of the good graces of many a fantasy analyst because of his ""poor"" performance this year. I put poor in air quotes because it seems like little to no context is being taken into consideration. So here are some plain and simple facts:

* Going into the start of the season, Zeke was the consensus RB3 on FantasyPros PPR dynasty rankings, only behind CMC and Saquon.

* The offensive line was beat up all season. Only Zack Martin and Connor Williams were healthy through week 5 (the week Dak was injured), and the remaining starters combined for just 5 games played through those 5 weeks.

* Despite the decimated offensive line, Zeke still gained 547 combined yards, with 24 receptions and 6 touchdowns, through week 5, and through week 5 was the RB3 in all formats, behind only Kamara and Cook.

* If you were to extrapolate Zeke's numbers from weeks 1-5 into an entire season, he would be the RB2 in PPR and 0.5 PPR behind Kamara, and RB3 in Standard behind Kamara and Cook.

* Zeke is the same age as Kamara and Cook, and a year older than CMC.

* Zeke has only had one injury in his NFL career, and has missed only one game due to injury, whereas Kamara has had two injuries (ankle and knee in 2019) and missed two games, Cook has battled numerous injuries throughout his career, and CMC had two injuries (thigh and shoulder this year) that caused him to miss all but three games this season.

* Zeke is currently ranked as the RB11 in FantasyPros PPR dynasty rankings, whereas CMC, Kamara and Cook are RBs 1-3.

I think it's inevitable that Zeke's value will rise as people wash away the bad taste in their mouths that was the last two thirds of the Cowboys' season, but for now, you should be trying to acquire him in dynasty leagues.",fantasyfootball,4,1610058085,ksod7s,1

|Rookie Year|RANK|REC|YDS|TDS|FPTS|FPTS/G|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Justin Jefferson (2020)|WR8|79|1,267|7|251.9|16.8|

|Randy Moss (1998)|WR1|64|1,281|16|290.5|19.4|

Many of these rookies also had another receiver getting points 

&amp;#x200B;

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Adam Thielen|WR10|70|868|14|244.3|17.5|

|Ruben Randle|WR40|65|780|3|161|10.7|
|Freddie Jones|TE9|53|487|3|119.7|7.98|
|Cris Carter|WR8|72|933|12|231.2|16.5|

OBJ and Boldin were able to put up big numbers without another top target on the team 

&amp;#x200B;

What can we expect from Jefferson looking at the 2nd year numbers for these receivers?

|Second Year|RANK|REC|YDS|TDS|FPTS|FPTS/G|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Michael Thomas|WR5|98|1,151|5|243.1|16.2|
|Odell Beckham Jr.|WR5|91|1,396|13|308.9|22.1|
|Anquan Boldin|WR59|53|592|1|116.5|12.9|
|Randy Moss|WR2|75|1258|10|274.2|18.3|

Anquan Boldin missed the first 6 games of the season and Larry Fitzgerald was drafted that year but Fitzgerald did not make much of an impact. 

This was Michael Thomas's first year without Brandin Cooks on the other side and did not disappoint. 

OBJ and Randy Moss have big second years just like their first. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no doubt Justin Jefferson will be a top 10 WR next year if he stays healthy.

94,Building a better auto-drafter using a gene-finding algorithm,kevinthechickengod,"***Background - An overview of Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi Algorithm***


A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model used to ‚Äúdecode‚Äù a sequence of symbols by assigning them to their most likely state. They‚Äôre mostly important for speech recognition and analysis, but also have uses in biological sequence analysis and signal processing. In short, they can be thought of as a finite number of states which have associated probabilities for state transitions. A diagram of a basic HMM can be seen below:


https://i.imgur.com/fiDcBDM.png


The Viterbi algorithm uses the structure of HMMs to find the ‚Äúpath‚Äù through the series of observations with the maximum likelihood. It works by building a table containing the most likely path given n previous observations, assuming the path ends at a certain state. The fundamental equation for the Viterbi algorithm is as follows:


https://i.imgur.com/LslM42F.png


By abusing the idea behind this equation - and abandoning the first order Markovian assumption used to build a proper HMM - we can translate this to fantasy football drafts. Treat the states as positions in a league, and the sequence of observations can be the picks made in each round. Rather than maximizing the probability of a path, we can find the sequence of players picked at each round that provides the maximum projected point sum.


The Viterbi algorithm used for this would look something like this:


https://i.imgur.com/DHz0cEX.png


***Program***


This program takes in data I collected from ESPN containing their player projections and ADP from this summer. It then takes user input on their draft slot, weights associated with drafting each position, and league information, as well as a randomness value I‚Äôll discuss later. Using this information, the program performs two actions:


  * Executes the Viterbi algorithm

  * Simulates non-user picks


***Some nuances to the Viterbi implementation:***


Transition probabilities reflect the current number of each position taking to reach that point in the table - this is where the Markovian assumption is violated. 


Player projections are valued as their projected points minus the projected points of the player at that same position whose ADP exceeds the user‚Äôs next pick. This is to incorporate positional value and scarcity to the calculations - so if you have picks 8 and 16 and the TE1 ADP is 17, the projected value of that player at pick 8 would be zero.


After the picks prior to the user‚Äôs current pick are simulated, the best available player at each position is ‚Äúselected‚Äù, and this player is returned when backtracking the maximum path in the table.


The last pick is almost always a QB. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a bug since the calculations to get there seem correct, but this should be kept in mind when assigning positional weights. Regardless, weights must exceed zero.


***On how picks are simulated:***


A list containing all players sorted by their ADP is iterated over. If their ADP is less than the pick the simulation is beginning with, they are marked selected. If their ADP is between the beginning pick and the simulation end pick, they are entered into a lottery to choose who gets picked. This lottery assigns pick probabilities using a Chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom dependent on that player‚Äôs ADP, meaning players with lower ADPs are more likely to get selected here. This is to approximate real behavior during drafts. The randomness input entered by the user also influences the shape of the distribution, causing different behavior when drafting. Higher randomness is less random, as counter-intuitive as that is.


To ensure that the correct number of players are picked during simulations, if the number of picked players is less than the desired amount, the remainder are randomly sampled from players who were considered but not picked. If it is greater than the desired amount, only the first N players are selected, and the rest are marked as not picked.


***Advantages***


This program should stand to improve on current auto-drafters by forming a plan to maximize the draft sequence, consider positional weights in a more realistic way, and exploit differences between ADP and projected points. Users can also modify the data to incorporate their own personal preferences or league styles - if no QBs ever get picked before the third round, say, raising each QB ADP will lead to a more realistic plan.


***Disadvantages***


Due to the added complexity compared to how auto-drafting currently works, it may not always be intuitive and does have known errors (and I'm sure many unknown ones). It also only produces a plan before the draft takes place - mid-draft updates would require work from the user. (This is a next step to improve). The plan can also be thrown off by unexpected player selections.


***Running the program:***


The program and instructions to get it working can be found here: https://github.com/eapanthers/AutoDrafter


There isn‚Äôt substantial error catching, so only ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù inputs will work, but hopefully these values are clear.


***Sample outputs:***

[This is part 19 of a series I'm writing on learning Python with Fantasy Football.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/blog/intermediate/19) 

In this part of the series, we plot [end-of-season fantasy points](https://imgur.com/a/CFTOH6A) with a stacked bar plot for the top 50 RBs in PPR format and talk a bit about evaluating end-of-season rankings. This visualization here is meant to show how each player stacked up against each other (we can see Kamara/Cook/Henry are in their own tier) and also show *where* RBs got their points from.

If you're unfamiliar with Python, it's a programming language that's heavily used in the data science. I started my site as a way to teach people Python through a topic they find actually interesting, fantasy football. If you're just starting out, [I recommend checking out my beginner series here.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/blog/beginner/1)

2,TE Weighted Opportunities per Game,jakelaser1080,"Just like my previous [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/krnwsl/wr_weighted_opportunities_per_game/), here is the Tight End Weighted Opportunities per Game graphic. 

For those unfamiliar, Weighted Opportunities per Game is an advanced FF statistic that denotes a number comparable to Fantasy Points per game (0.5 PPR in this case) which factors in between the 20s targets, rushes, redzone targets and redzone rushes.

The chart below shows the difference between WO/G and FP/G, which can be a positive or negative number. On a basic level, this difference demonstrates if the player performed above expectation or below expectation based on their opportunity. There is no clear ""this player busted"" or ""this player will regress negatively next year"" statement to be made, but we can use this information to guide our thoughts on what happened this year, predict a trend going into next season, and visualize which players performed above or below their opportunities.

**For our Tight End graphic**, predictably, Kelce was dominant. Last year, we were missing the touchdowns and this year he got a lot of everything (TDs, yards, receptions, etc). Waller was a man amongst boys, it's easy to argue he's worth the #2 spot next year with his health compared to Kittle.

Despite a stellar season, Logan Thomas actually left some room to be desired (thanks Haskins...) and Engram was just a flat out disappointment with drops and bad targets from Jones. Ertz was basically on that same level of disappointment for his various reasons. 

Tonyan only had 59 targets in 16 games this year. He also had 11 red zone looks. These numbers are the same as Tyler Eifert (60 targets in 15 games, 11 RZ targets). Tonyan finished as the TE3 in 0.5 PPR this year. That's the difference in QB talent and making the most of your opportunities despite being near the bottom of this list in WO/G. He's likely a negative regression candidate unless those targets come up.

This is the final WO/G post, but I plan on doing a bunch more Advanced Fantasy Football Analysis this off season! Stay tuned for more graphics!

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team‚Äôs matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you‚Äôre in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‚ÄòEm game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

**Please do not post screenshots of your matchups.**

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn‚Äôt give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

Currently in a start up league we voted on a super flex but it took the place of one of the two standard FLEX spots. I convinced the Commish to put it to a vote to see if we can remove Team D for a reg FLEX and its currently not looking good. I thought part of the fun of a dynasty was on keeping an eye on individual player development so many defenses go from great to trash and vice versa why bother streaming in this format.

I‚Äôm sure some of you have heard about the [FFPC Playoff Challenge](https://myffpc.com/cms/public/play/ffpc-playoff-challenge/), but if you haven‚Äôt it‚Äôs a really unique contest that is sort of a mix of a best ball contest played with a contrarian mindset. There is a main $200 contest and a smaller $35 offering as well. I absolutely love this contest every year so I decided to deep dive it, and trust me I went all the way in!

**The best trades are the ones where both sides believe they are winning**  

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

League specific rules and scoring   
Player(s) that are being traded  
Player(s) that you may be dropping or picking up as part of the trade

41,"Travis Kelce finished as the RB4, and WR3 overall in 2020",SaskalPiakam,"Travis Kelce finished as the RB4, and WR3 in 2020 .5PPR formats. He is a no brainer top 5-8 re-draft selection going into 2021. It's absolutely insane how much of a positional advantage he gives you which I'm sure most know, but to see how he'd literally be a high end RB1 or WR1 in a league where we had a WR put up 18 TDs and a RB rush for 2000 yards really puts it in perspective. 

In 2018, he finished as the RB7 and WR8 overall so this isn't some crazy outlier. 2019 he was a borderline WR1 and RB1 but Patrick Mahomes missed a quarter of that season due to a knee cap injury. 

Every year I trick myself into thinking you need to start robust RB and often look at my mocks in the summer and not liking the appearance of my squads that don't feature 2 players I think could be RB1s for me. No longer making that mistake.",fantasyfootball,7,1609971514,krynr6,1
42,"New Paid League Type, need members. Relegation Leagues!",garthdore,"Next year I start The Collective, a group of connected fantasy football leagues. Its been my dream to start this and want to get a group of players from all skill ranges that enjoy doing different things with fantasy. I dont care how great or horrible at fantasy the owners are, I want people who are active and have passion for fantasy football. Respond to trades, vote on league matters, set lineups, even at the end of the season.

The Collective:  
Relegation Lower League (Welcome Collective)  
Relegation Upper League (Premier Collective)

The core part of The Collective are the 2 relegation leagues. Much like non-US soccer leagues, these two leagues would be connected to where at the end of the season, the bottom 2 teams of the premier league would move down to the welcome league and the top two leagues would move up to the premier league. Over time this creates a highly competitive league at the top, a new player friendly league at the bottom. In this format there is no waitlist needed as the welcome league is the waitlist.  
Note\* The 2 leagues would NOT share players and managers can only be in one of the leagues.  
Other important features of The Collective:  
Platform - Sleeper  
Sleeper allows for easy slack style chats where we can have interleague communication as well as league only coms  
Relegation leagues may expand to more than just 2 leagues over time as the collective grows  
Scoring format and rosters will be identical throughout all Collective Leagues  
\*There will be a interleague Collective championship in week 16 where champions of every league go head to head for another prize and trophy  
\*Inter league Pick‚Äôem, optional pickem league where you can pick winners from every matchup in all leagues for weekly cash prizes  
\*Weekly Magazine with weekly focuses on certain teams and matchup recaps  
\*Dues will be $60  
\*Monthly Podcast (tbd)

Each league will have 1 dues free spot. This person will be a league manager spot and that person will write up custom weekly recaps that go into the magazine and monthly ‚ÄúTrollfiles‚Äù where they focus in on one team.

Starting a whole new community. üì∑ message me if interested on here or reach out on sleeper: Its\_Just\_Fantasy\_Podcast",fantasyfootball,1,1609965811,krwqj9,1

Or do I need to set up another tab that calculates scores for each player and manually input their stats?

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

64,2021 Machine Learning RB/WR/TE Projections,San_Diego_Chargers_,"2021 Projections: https://imgur.com/a/lOhXvGj

Last January I released some 2020 projections I made using a python script fetching data from ProFootballReference. Here are how those projections fared against what actually happened in the 2020 season (PPR format):

https://i.imgur.com/fBvdOq7.png

The median error for these projections was 34 points, so 50% of the ~400 players projected finished with ¬± 34 PPR points of their projection.

Here are some of the projections that ended up being the most accurate:

https://i.imgur.com/mRvN0vo.png

And here are the projections that ended up being the least accurate:

https://i.imgur.com/d3uBLSU.png

Here is a visual of the overall results:

https://i.imgur.com/DRPMtng.png

If you're interested in how these projections were made and what factors are taken into account for each player I have a couple videos on the subject.

66,WR Weighted Opportunities per Game,jakelaser1080,"Similar to what I did in my post [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kr33un/rb_weighted_opportunity_per_game/), here is the Weighted Opportunities per Game graphic for wide receivers!

For those unfamiliar, Weighted Opportunities per Game is an advanced FF statistic that denotes a number comparable to Fantasy Points per game (0.5 PPR in this case) which factors in between the 20s targets, rushes, redzone targets and redzone rushes. 

The chart below shows the difference between WO/G and FP/G, which can be a positive or negative number. On a basic level, this difference demonstrates if the player performed above expectation or below expectation based on their opportunity. There is no clear ""this player busted"" or ""this player will regress negatively next year"" statement to be made, but we can use this information to guide our thoughts on what happened this year, predict a trend going into next season, and visualize which players performed above or below their opportunities.

**For example:** We can see that Adams and Hill performed highly above their opportunities, and a lot of that can be given to the fact that they were in prolific offenses and scored a lot of touchdowns. On the opposite end, Diontae Johnson (injuries, leaving games early, etc), and Michael Thomas (injuries, ineffectiveness in the redzone) performed well under their opportunities this season.

Tight Ends to come tomorrow!

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

I was dead wrong about DMont in the second half of the season.

19,Won my father in laws keeper league with 10 of his friends. It was my first year in and I sent this message to the group chat,bytorz212,"Great game @K

 Coming into this league as a rookie head coach , I knew there would be a lot of skepticism. I know the voices of the doubters, the haters, the critics are the ones that ring loudest, but in the end the voices of our FANS are all that we here. Our team owes this Championship entirely to our FANS. You guys are the reason we come into the stadium every week. Without you guys cheering us on and supporting us week in and week out we would have nothing to play for. 

It was a grueling season and our guys faced a lot of adversity but when the time came, they buckled up, played hard, and fought their way to a Championship win. Really as a head coach , I depend more on our players than they do on me. We have a very special squad this year. Our players never wavered in the face of defeat and every win was a grind. So thank you to our squad for making it happen. I am beyond proud of you boys. I want to give a special shout out to Derrick Henry, who is now the eighth player in NFL history to rush for 2,000+ yards, our team is happy to be apart of that, congratulations Derrick, you deserve it man. And of course a VERY Special shout out to whoever decided not to keep him last year. 

I want to thank our guys upstairs for making key mid season acquisitions, in particular Terry Mclaurin from Team Odell U Didn‚Äôt. When we found out he was available, our guys in the front office knew we had to get him, especially to help shore up our oft-injured wide receiving core. 

Again, we are absolutely honored to be this seasons Champions. Of course we will Celebrate this week  and enjoy a much needed break this off-season. Next year we will come back as focused as ever in our efforts to bring home BACK TO BACK Championships. Thank you everyone.

20,Way Too Early Keeper League Question,Blkudlac,[removed],fantasyfootball,1,1609868145,kr387z,1
21,RB Weighted Opportunity per Game,jakelaser1080,"For those who are interested in advanced fantasy football data analysis, I present the Weighted Opportunities per game graph. Weighted Opportunity is a representation of how RB touches correlate into fantasy football points (0.5 PPR in this case) based on historical data. (Thoughts and analysis based on Analyst Scott Barrett from FanstasyPoints).

For our data set below, weighted opportunity is based on RB touches / targets between the 20s, and RB touches / targets in the Redzone. Obviously, Redzone touches are weighted more than a between the 20s touch. Although pretty simple, this data can be expanded to consider the weight of touches closer to the goal line (5 yards out vs 18 yards out), but I will expand on that in the near future.

Preliminarily, you can use this graph to make some assumptions on certain players and attempt to predict regressions, opportunities, etc for next season.

**For Example**: Personally, I think Cook and Kamara are outliers in efficiency, and despite huge positive differential, they know how to make the most out of their touches. On the other hand, a player like Nick Chubb was able to create massive fantasy points despite limited opportunity compared to some of the other top backs. This could make one think that he's due for some negative regression next season if Hunt is continuing to take touches away, but he could just be an efficiency king like those in the top tier of RBs.

Hope you enjoy and let me know if you have any ideas on how to further expand! WR and TE post coming soon if interested!

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

Which players and teams do you like in this format?

I think Bills have the best chance of any team to play 4 total games. I am willing to prioritize them a little more than even the chiefs or packers. Except RB. Josh Allen no.1 overall.

73,Playoff best ball strategies,peterw16,"I am addicted to fantasy lol.  Underdog (and likely some others) do playoff best ball.  I've never played before but it seems like fun.

* 6 teams, one winner.  You should be very risky in order to come out on top.  Bet it all on a team you think could surprise.  If you loaded up with Titans last year you probably won.

* Don't worry about wild card weekend.  Antonio Gibson, Cooper Kupp, and Robert Woods go super late, so you will always find cheap production there if you want to load up on Packers and Chiefs.

* There is a lot less parity in the NFC than the AFC.  The NFC has two teams that don't look like they are going anywhere (WFT and Bears), whereas all the AFC wild card teams look like they could make a run for it.  Bucs and Saints are good bets to at least play multiple games, whereas a lot of teams in the AFC could play 4 games or could play 1 (Ravens/Titans, etc)

* Beware of Packers?  I feel decently confident that we won't see any big upsets in the NFC wild card: the Saints beat the Bears, Seahawks beat the Rams, and the Bucs beat the WFT.  This sets up a Bucs/Packers matchup in the divisional.  The Bucs are the only team to make the Packers look mortal all year.  I know this is a conditional warning, but you need to make calls based on limited info, and I am factoring this in.

8,Gary Kubiak (OC - MIN) is contemplating retirement,neverhaveiever23,"This is a potentially massive shift for Dalvin (and possibly the WRs).


Kubiak and his zone scheme are famous. He made his name as an OC off an almighty 2000 yard season by Terrell Davis then later turned Arian Foster (undrafted) into a star, even Justin forsett was viable in 2014 at the ravens. His latest rb, dalvin, thrived and supports Kubiak's case as a great rushing OC.


The rumour mill is swirling that Kubiak might retire. If this is the case, be weary and perhaps temper expectations for Dalvin. I'm not saying Cook will bust. But is his ceiling potentially capped? Possibly, yes. We may not see such ludicrous days. 


Of course, a new OC might have an equally good rb resume - norv turner? But yeah, something to keep an eye on for sure.",fantasyfootball,1,1609791677,kqgzhp,1

18,Is Bieniemy going to be a HC trap like Gase was?,Specter017,"Asking as someone who is NOT a chiefs fan, nor do I watch many of their games but Bieniemy is in a very similar situation that Adam Gase was in. Both are at the helm of explosive offenses being led by generational HOF talent QB's. The big reason I bring this up is because we got a taste of what the Chiefs look like without Mahomes yesterday and they seemed like an average team, nothing special. This sends a red flag to me that it's Mahomes, not Bieniemy that's making this offense so great. 

So that being said, I have to ask what stands out about Bieniemy that you would say makes his situation different than Gase? Keep in mind I'm not calling a shot here, I'm simply opening a discussion as I would like to know if there's something I'm missing or don't know about the situation.",fantasyfootball,1,1609788305,kqfrvl,1

20,Russell Wilson has fallen off in the second half of the last two seasons. Is this a trend or weird anomaly?,JesusChristSupers1ar,"Wilson finished this season at 22.5 points per game and last season at 20.5 points per game but it's very front-heavy. This year he averaged 18.9 points per game after week 10 and last season he averaged 13.98 after week 10. In this period he only has two games above 20 points (both this season) and none above 23 points

it doesn't seem like this was an issue for him previous in his career but I'll admit, I'm a little scarred from this season and last where his lackluster games happened in playoff games in which I lost. Unless he falls past QB12 (which is unlikely), I'll probably avoid just on emotion

Look at this thread from prior to the season

And this one

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/j8jp2c/tom_brady_in_2020_392_attempts_per_game_jameis/


The big narrative was that Brady wasn‚Äôt going to have the big volume numbers because he wasn‚Äôt going to throw the ball nearly as much as winston did in 2019 and Tampa wouldn‚Äôt be down as often this season. He also apparently  wasn‚Äôt good at throwing downfield anymore

Well actually Tom threw the ball 610 times this season and Winston did 626 times in 2019.  Tom was obviously much more efficient. Another one was how Brady would die behind the bad bucs offensive line, well actually he was sacked fewer times this year(21) than he was last year in NE(27).  In a much more aggressive downfield passing offense with 4 of the 5 starters returning he had one of the lowest sack and pressure rates in the League.",fantasyfootball,1,1609781921,kqdio2,1

45,Best Unowned Team - Week 17 2020 and a Review of 2020,fritothedog,"**Week 17 Team**

This is the best lineup using players owned in 5% of leagues or less according to Yahoo. I will do it with 0.5ppr scoring rules. 

**POS - PLAYER, TEAM - OWNED% - SCORE**

* **QB - Mason Rudolph - PIT - 0% - 19.7**
* **RB - Darwin Thompson - KC - 0% - 26.5**
* **RB - Antonio Williams - BUF - 0% - 20.8**
* **WR - Isaiah McKenzie - BUF - 0% - 27.5**
* **WR - Byron Pringle - KC - 0% - 13.2**
* **TE - Pharaoh Brown - HOU - 0% - 13.3**
* **FLEX - Josh Adams - RB - NYJ - 0% - 12.9**
* **D/ST - New York Jets - 5% - 2**
* **K - Sam Sloman - TEN  - 0% - 12**

This team is available in 95% of leagues and would've scored 147.9 points. This was one of the least predictable weeks I can think, all but one member of the team was 0% owned. 

Rudolph was possibly the most predictable. There were a few options, with Wolford, Glennon, Henne, and Beathard all starting this week as well. Still, Rudolph scored well and hit a deep pass to Johnson. As an Oklahoma State alum, I hope he can actually be serviceable as a back up, I still don't think he is the future of Pittsburgh though. 

Darwin finally got his time to shine. This subs sleeper darling of 2019 never came to fruition, and he got buried further by them drafting CEH, and then obtaining Bell. He was given 21 touches in a meaningless week 17 game but he turned the opportunity into quite a performance, scoring 2 TDs in the process, one on the ground and one through the air. 

Raise your hand if you drafted Singletary and Moss this year like I did. Isn't it great to see Antonio Williams post the highest single game score of any Bills RB this year? The Bills pulled their starters fairly early in this contest. Singletary and Moss each played 28% of snaps, Williams played the other 44% and capitalized with 2 TDs. 

Isaiah McKenzie has had some buzz in dynasty circles. Any Bills WR was playable this week, Diggs, Brown, Davis and McKenzie all scored well. Beasley was out this week and, again, starters were pulled so the opportunity was there for the rookies to get more playing time. The Dolphins have been a solid defense and the Bills rumbled right through them.

Byron Pringle was a one hit wonder last year as well. I suppose anyone can in that offense. With starters resting he saw 6 targets and posted 52 yards and a TD. 

Pharaoh Brown led the HOU TE group. I hadn't heard of him before this week. I wouldn't expect this to be a sign of things to come as he will be a free agent and Akins and Fells are under contract. 

Josh Adams made the team again. With Gore and Perine out, Ty Johnson got the majority of the work as expected, but it was Adams who scored.

The Jets again made the team, three weeks in a row. this time, basically because they were the only team owned in 5% or less leagues. JAX, ATL, and DET were the only ones owned less. 

Cody Parkey merely adopted the doink, Sloman was born with it, molded by it. A game winner doinked through the uprights landed Sloman on the unowned team this week. 

**Best Unowned Team - Top All Year 2020**

**POS - PLAYER, TEAM - WEEK - SCORE**

* **QB - Marcus Mariota - LV - Week 15 - 26.84**
* **RB - Jeff Wilson Jr. - SF - Week 7 - 31**
* **RB - Samaje Perine - CIN - Week 16 - 27.6**
* **WR - Richie James - SF - Week 9 - 28.9**
* **WR - Isaiah McKenzie - BUF - Week 17 - 27.5**
* **TE - Anthony Firkser - TEN - Week 6 - 21.3**
* **FLEX - Trey Burton - TE - IND - Week 6 - 19.9**
* **D/ST - Atlanta Falcons - Week 12 - 28**
* **K - Tyler Bass - BUF - Week 7 - 23**

This team would've scored 234.04 points. 

Week 7 was the highest scoring week with 157.96, which makes sense due to the top RB and top Kicker posting big numbers in that week. Week 6 was the week of the TE I guess, with the top TE coming that week, as well as the top flex option all year being a TE that same week.

Throughout the year, 5 players made the team 3 times, none appeared on the team more than three times. Three were defenses (ATL, NYJ, and JAX). Cairo Santos was the kicker three different weeks, and  Devontae Booker made the a RB or flex spot 3 times. 

Miami's D/ST made the team twice, Week 3 and Week 5, before continuing on their way to a 4th place finish and are now 67% owned. Noone expected that strong of a turnaround and the future is bright in Miami.

Kalen Ballage, interestingly, made the team twice, once as a Jet and once as a Charger.

65,2020: Top Scoring Team and Yearly Review,plastictaxicab,"Well, l truly wasn't sure we'd make it here with everything going on this year, but here we are! Before we get started on a recap of the 2020 fantasy season, here is your Week 17 Top Scoring Team - The Week That Doesn't Matter:

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

**QB Cam Newton 37.48**

**WR Marvin Jones Jr. 30.00**

**WR Brandin Cooks 28.60**

**RB Jonathan Taylor 37.40**

**RB Derrick Henry 35.00**

**TE Darren Waller 17.70**

**FLEX JK Dobbins 28.00**

**K Greg Zuerlein/Ka'imi Fairbairn 16.00**

**DST Buffalo 21.00**

This lineup would've given you 251.18 points. Cam looking like Cam of the past, and good to see Waller on the list again as he broke the single season reception record for the Raiders. Congrats Darren!

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

# And now, here is your 2020 top scoring lineup (standard scoring, Yahoo):

**QB Patrick Mahomes 40.00 (Week 3)**

**WR Tyreek Hill 44.90 (Week 12)**

**WR Tyler Lockett 38.00 (Week 7)**

**RB Alvin Kamara 53.20 (Week 16)**

**RB Dalvin Cook 46.60 (Week 8)**

**FLEX Aaron Jones 41.60 (Week 2)**

**K Stephen Gostkowski 25.00 (Week 3)**

**DST New England 29.00 (Week 13)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

This lineup would've given you 350.30. This is purely for the fun of looking back at the top team of the year, and once again, the 2020 team beat the top team last year, this time by 20 points! 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here are a few fun facts for the year:

**Appropriately enough, the top scoring individual team this year was Week 16's team with 264.10 points. Championship week!**

An extra little fun fact: this year at the flex position, an RB made the list 8 times, a WR 6 times, and a TE 2 times.

I'll start with mine for PPR:

QB1: Kyler Murray - He will continue his high rushing volume and improve his connection with Hopkins. Cardinals will also improve the pieces around him by potentially adding a solid WR2 to replace Fitzgerald in the draft. He will be the perfect fantasy combination of an elite rusher and an elite passer and will put up an even better performance than he did in 2020.

RB1: CMC - He will once again return to 2019 form, but this time on an improved offense with an improved QB in Bridgewater. Matt Rhule will keep him on the field for a league leading snap % and will result in him putting up 30 points per game in PPR, potentially repeating his 2019 campaign.

TE1: Kelce - This one's pretty self explanatory XD

WR1: Ridley - The trade rumors surrounding Julio Jones will come to fruition. Falcons will improve their offense and coaching and Ridley will emerge as the clear WR1 on that offense. Without Julio Jones, Ridley will lead the league in targets and get close to 180 targets. He will be like 2019's Mike Thomas.",fantasyfootball,1,1609766658,kq8ojv,1

85,Super subjective 5-round mock for 2021 (no FAs &amp; no rookies),Brettzel2,"Hi all, I've been obsessing over potential 2021 rankings and thought I'd share a 5-round mock for 12-team PPR. This list doesn't include free agents (like Aaron Jones &amp; Allen Robinson) or rookies to avoid overcomplication. These are very subjective and are bound to get a ton of criticism, which is one of the reasons I elected to post them. A lot of decisions here are down to speculation. I didn't want to copy and paste the final PPR rankings from this year into these rankings, because every year is different and players' values go up and down based on many circumstances. Davante Adams, for instance, isn't my WR1 because the Packers are bound to add more receiving targets in the offseason (if they make the right decisions) which will drop his value. Also, with the exception of Kelce, players who were #1 at their position are fairly unlikely to repeat a #1 performance the following year. I also tried to keep injury risk out of my rankings. Injuries are unpredictable and shouldn't affect rankings too heavily. For instance, Dalvin Cook was being severely undervalued last year because of his injury history (I even saw people rank him outside of the top-10 altogether). It seems like many times players who have an injury history surprise everyone and don't get injured, and players with no injury history randomly go down (CMC and Thomas). This rankings are based off how I believe the season will play out IF each player stays healthy the whole season. This isn't the first time I posted 2021 rankings. If you're tired of seeing them I'm so sorry LOL.

86,"For all that hate that Week 17 gets, this was among the greatest Fantasy weeks in recent memory.",SontagWrong,"I understand the inclination to eliminate Week 17 championships. Between playoff teams resting key starters and the occasional blatant tank, the final week brings unique volatility to an already unpredictable sport. 

That being said, this week was *fantastic* for Fantasy. As a player in a Week 16 championship league, it felt bittersweet watching some of my players post ridiculous numbers this week. Imagine how great it would've felt to see these performances on your team:

‚Ä¢¬†JT rushes for 253 yards and two touchdowns (39.4 points) 

‚Ä¢ Derrick Henry breaks 2,000 yards in an absolute thriller

‚Ä¢ David Montgomery (28.2) and J.K. Dobbins (28.0) cement themselves as league-winning pickups

‚Ä¢¬†Jeff Wilson Jr. delivers again for 23.8 points in PPR

‚Ä¢ Emmanuel Sanders gets his contract incentive, posting 9/63/1

‚Ä¢ Antonio Brown validates his believers, posting 11/138/2 as Brady goes for 399 yards

‚Ä¢¬†Herbert shattering the rookie passing TD record en route to 38.98 fantasy points

‚Ä¢¬†The Bills D/ST posts *three* touchdowns against the Dolphins

‚Ä¢¬†Diggs &amp; Josh Allen get it done in just one half of football 

‚Ä¢¬†Aaron Rodgers cements his MVP case, Davante Adams comes through in the clutch once more

‚Ä¢¬†Alexander Mattison wins you the handcuff lottery with 22/95/1 on the ground, 3/45/1 through the air (in a simply *thrilling* game against DET) 

‚Ä¢ Last but not least, Washington D/ST puts forth a fantastic performance against a dumpster fire of an Eagles team.

Look down on Week 17 championships all you want, but it was rough seeing these guys all go off after my season ended. Week 17 has a certain unpredictable, chaotic charm to it, and I think we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it.",fantasyfootball,1,1609744200,kq3ll2,1

Also heard the idea on this subreddit to donate to players charity‚Äôs so I will be donating to Davante Adam‚Äôs and buying his jersey this year since he was my MVP! Thank you all so much for this community and for helping me become a league champion!

8,"W17 Champs, Congratulations",Another_Name_Today,"Last week there were threads discussing the outcome championship week, celebrating victory and lamenting defeat. Whether it was a one week final or two week final, intentional or because of ESPN‚Äôs goofy settings, you had one more week of competition. You adjusted for the Chiefs and the Steelers, hopefully dug up some hidden gems, and maybe even saw MBC pretend it was 2017. 

It‚Äôs late in the third quarter of the Football/Eagles game and some of you are still sweating, others are up so big it‚Äôs a virtual lock, and a bunch are already done. But a victor will be crowned soon enough. 

For those of you who lost, there is always next year. For those of you who won, congratulations on running the full 17 of 17 gauntlet.

And to those of you who provided analysis through this week (looking at you u/subvertadown), thanks for not forgetting about us.",fantasyfootball,1,1609731158,kq07zy,1

40,How Important is the Draft Order? - Survey,ze_shotstopper,"Hi there! As fantasy football fans, we all covet the same thing every August, the 1st overall pick. I've always wondered just how important that 1st pick really is, so to find out, I created a survey. If you're curious like me, please consider filling this survey out. I know that ESPN emails you with a draft recap, so you might have to dig that out to answer this.

Here's what I'm asking for:

\- Your league name (I will not share this with anyone)

\- The number of teams

\- The platform and scoring method

\- The final standing of every draft position

Please consider sharing this survey with your friends and family who play fantasy football, as I would love to collect as much information as possible, which would provide a better idea of how important the draft order is.

Thank you!

Here is the link to the survey:

44,Fantasy Football League for Playoffs,SauceyBoiYT,"As many people have been asking about Fantasy Football Leagues for the playoffs, I have created a league format that can be run with minimal input. 

Rules:

 

Teams: 4

Roster: QB, RB, WR, 2FLEX, RB/WR, K, DST, No Bench

Player Pool: Players can be repeated on rosters 2x (2 versions of any player). The second version of a player will be worth 50% points. Assuming a player isn‚Äôt injured, their backup will be the 2nd version of them.

Scoring: 1ppr, 1pt = 10yds (rush/receive), 1pt = 25yds (pass), 6pt Rush/catch TD, 4pt Pass TD, Fractional Kicker scoring (0.1 pts per yard on FGs), Standard DST scoring

Bracket: Full Rotisserie (No H2H, only final points for)

Scoring Multipliers: x1 for 1st start, x2 for 2nd start, x3 for 3rd start, x4 for 4th start. Starts must be consecutive 

Draft: Snake, 8 Rounds

Platform: Sleeper (optional), Only used for draft and setting lineups. 

Standings: All scoring will be kept track of on an independent google sheet that everyone will be able to view

Link to [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17DykGBqSvRgUi8XhfoBBd0mV2rcONCghe1IGSITkXRM/edit?usp=sharing), you will need to copy and paste onto a different spreadsheet on 4 different pages. If you input the players' stats into the spreadsheet under the respective category and input the respective multiplier into the multiplier column for the player, both the final score without multiplier and with multiplier will be automatically calculated. If you have any questions, please let me know in the comments and I will do my best to answer them.",fantasyfootball,1,1609718719,kpwgo8,1

88,What's the most important thing you learned this Fantasy Season,Toodlum,"For me, it was trusting your gut and going with my initial reaction and not overanalyzing things. For instance, I was impressed pretty early on by both the Chiefs and Saints defenses and added them before they blew up. I thought James Robinson might be something special so I picked him up off waivers. I think my problem for a long time was that I used to trust the expert's opinions more than my own eyes.",fantasyfootball,1,1609706408,kpsjd1,1

99,How effective are elite running backs on new teams?,Ech10100,With the potential move of Aaron Jones to a new team is there anywhere to find history of running backs who moved to new teams? There was a large stigma surrounding wide receivers and new teams which was broken by DHop and Diggs this year however is the same stigma applied to running backs?

Already seems to be over.",koolman631,,fantasyfootball,1,1609699673,kpq8lz,1
2,Worst part of the play where Mike Evans got injured? Tom Brady also seemed to hit his hand on a helmet after the throw and dealing with an hand problem now.

6,Why did ESPN remove the play by play list of games on the App,spebmc998,"A few weeks ago you could look at the whole list of games being played for the week. It was really easy to switch between them and get a overall look at how games were going for the day. See the scores and who was the top scorers for each game. It was simple and worked, it was my favorite feature of the ESPN fantasy app.

Now the only way to get to the play by play is going to a player that is in the game. Now I have to search for players that I don‚Äôt own (in this league) in order to see other games I care about.",fantasyfootball,1,1609698425,kppt59,1
7,Defensive scoring categories,skhalid707,"Our league wants to use defensive scoring categories like passes defensed, and stuffs. Does anyone know how much these two things happen per game? I‚Äôm trying to figure out appropriate scoring for them.",fantasyfootball,1,1609698360,kppsex,1
8,Someone explain to me the logic behind ESPN's standard 2-week final? It seems like the dumbest idea to me.,geemack98,"You use savvy pickups and strategy and build a core group of players all year, and suddenly in your FINAL you're having to bench some of your best players due to them being rested? Weighing whether some other players will play whole games or just a few series? How is this logical at all.

My commissioner swears it's ""just like accounting for possible injuries"" but it's not imo.",fantasyfootball,1,1609697832,kppm4p,1

In each category, we have how many Fantasy Points Per Game the defense has given up, who their opponent is, and how many fantasy points per game the team has accrued so far in 2020. Along with that, we have every stat you need to find the perfect match-ups this weekend. Whether you're playing season-long or DFS, this matchup tool has the most stats that will help out. Will update the PIT/BAL players once the game is played and stats are up to date!

**Again, this chart isn't optimized for mobile so it's best to open it up on a desktop with the many stats and columns the tables have. Just a heads up.**

If I happened to miss some players please let me know and I'll get them added. I went through the list of players who have been confirmed out, and have removed/added the players who will be replacing them.

I currently am the commissioner in a 12 team league where we have 4 divisions with 3 teams each. It works out nice because we can have each team play the other 2 division teams twice and every other team once. 

I want to incorporate the extra week, but keep it so every team plays each other at least once. I was thinking of keeping the 13 week regular season. Then having playoffs in week 14, 15 and then a 2 week championship match in 16 and 17.

52,Maximizing Your (Kickoff) Return on Investment: Week 17,Chronik_Liar,"Good morning and happy new year return yards players! As always these posts are targeted for people who are in leagues that score return yards with the preferred scoring being 1 point per 10 return yards.

Lately it seems like we‚Äôve been getting at least one punt return touchdown each week and in week 16 it was Jamal Agnew who got it done while recording the only points for the Lions. Diontae Spencer had the most return yardage on the day, finishing with 157 total return yards while Darrynton Evans was not too far behind him with 145 total return yards.

[Here are the projections for week 17.](https://twitter.com/SLFootballGuys/status/1344630002919362565/photo/1) 

**Good Returners for Week 17:**

*Ameer Abdullah (KR)* ‚Äì Abdullah didn‚Äôt get a single return opportunity last week, but that was expected against the strong leg of Wil Lutz. Going up against his former team is a different story, as the Lions are the league‚Äôs worst in touchback percentage at 32.39%. Dalvin Cook not playing due to personal reasons will only help Abdullah and give him more opportunities on offense as the change of pace back for Minnesota.

*Cordarrelle Patterson (KR)* ‚Äì Last time against Green Bay, Patterson was held to only 2 kick return attempts for 41 return yards. This time looks a little different as Green Bay is one of the league‚Äôs lowest in touchback percentage over the last 3 games at 38.89%. Patterson has been nursing a knee injury for the past week or so but was good to go this past Sunday with the same designation. He looks to be on track to play again today but next in line on the depth chart is Darnell Mooney, who would be just as good as a play as Patterson if he can‚Äôt go.

*Jamal Agnew (KR/PR)* ‚Äì I faded Agnew for the bad matchup against Tampa Bay last week, but he fared well as the Buccaneers ran up the score and Agnew was able to take advantage of a punt return opportunity for a touchdown. He‚Äôs in a much better situation this week against the Vikings in a projected high scoring matchup where Minnesota has gradually been kicking fewer touchbacks over the past couple of weeks.

**Returners I‚Äôm Fading Week 17:**

*Ray-Ray McCloud (KR/PR)* ‚Äì McCloud had a good outing the previous week against Indianapolis, running back 4 kickoffs and 2 punts for 89 total return yards. This week looks like a little tougher of a task in a projected low scoring matchup against Cleveland who have kicked more touchbacks at home than away.

Good luck to all of those that are still in it this week!",fantasyfootball,1,1609684020,kplgoo,1
53,I present: the COMBINED less-than-100%-rostered starting line-up!,Nickmagliato,"Like many of you, I didn‚Äôt make the playoffs. Thanks, Obama. 

Still, I wanted to have a little fun to make this meaningless consolation playoff a bit more, um, meaningful. 

So! 

I put together a rag-tag group of players‚Äînay, fantasy gods‚Äîthat, with their powers combined, totaled less than 100% rostered (according to Yahoo).

Without further ado, I present my squad:

QB Andy Dalton (14%)
WR Cam Sims (2%)
WR Zach Pascal (6%) 
RB Ty Montgomery (1%) 
RB Malcolm Brown (21%) 
TE Irv Smith Jr. (16%) 
FLEX Dare Ogunbowale (9%) 
K Graham Gano (6%) 
DEF Dallas (23%) 

Total: 98% rostered.

Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.

26,"Fantasy Rankings ‚Äì NFC North Challenge [Looking for Vikings, Bears, and Packer fans]",NotFromSaidCountry,"About a week ago, I was thinking about Fantasy Football Rankings, and if different platforms, careers, fanbases, subreddits, etc. etc. could be an indicator for if someone was likely going to be more accurate or not.

Last week we did the [Reddit vs Radio Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kixypb/fantasy_rankings_reddit_vs_radio_team_reddit/) where we had 2 members from Detroit Sports Radio ([The DTM Squatch](https://twitter.com/DanLeach971) and [JeffRiger](https://twitter.com/riger1984)) compete against 2 Redditors who are a part of r/fantasyfootball (u/PeakedInHighSkool and u/clunas7).  We put $100 for the winning team (so $50 per teammate), and [Team Reddit ended up winning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kn65l5/fantasy_rankings_reddit_vs_radio_challenge/)!  

This week, we wanted to give those radio guys another shot, but instead of facing one team of 2, wanted to add a bit more competition, and do an NFC North Challenge for Week 17 (4 teams of 2).  

Since they‚Äôre on the radio from the Detroit area, Dan and Jeff are going to represent Team Detroit Lions.  So we‚Äôre looking for volunteers to make up teams for the rest of the NFC North. 

We‚Äôve been setting our rankings on the [rancup app](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/jj8tak/after_years_of_seeing_posts_dedicated_to_rankings/) and for this last week, **we‚Äôre giving out $300 to the person who has the most accurate rankings across all positions, then another $100 for this NFC North Challenge ($50 per teammate).**  If you‚Äôre a fan of either the Bears, Vikings, or Packers and want to represent that fanbase in this challenge, let me know üòä",fantasyfootball,1,1609612022,kp2n3n,1

We all check our lineups a dozen times the night before the game, so this thread is perfect for those type of people looking to do some last minute tinkering. Sure, everyone says to start your studs but we all know you‚Äôre thinking about finally moving that bench guy into the lineup because he‚Äôs been getting more usage and this week might be the week he finally blows up.  Please list scoring details and other players on your bench when you're looking for feedback on setting your roster.  

Just remember, people give advice of their own goodwill here and if it doesn‚Äôt work out for you, don‚Äôt come back to gloat/criticize others' advice with the benefit of hindsight.

54,"2020 ""significant"" points per game",Brettzel2,"So I didn't come up with this, but I think it's super interesting. It was actually posted on the Instagram account fantasyfootball.101 (they did the calculations). It takes each player's points per game from 2020 ONLY counting the games where they played the full game. The reason I think this useful is because obviously many players got injured and had their season long stats affected by it. It gives a sense of how players would have ranked IF they played the entire season. Anyways I thought I'd copy and paste the RB rankings from their account to give an idea of how players ranked:

1. Kamara, 25.18

2. Cook, 24.45

3. Henry, 19.87

4. A. Jones, 18.94

5. Chubb, 18.86

6. Ekeler, 18.23

7. Robinson, 17.89

8. Carson, 17.24

9. Mixon, 16.6

10. Gaskin, 16.28

11. Gibson, 15.98

12. Montgomery, 15.79

13. Jacobs, 15.77

14. D. Johnson, 15.69

15. Elliott, 15.44

16. Taylor, 15.31

17. Conner, 14.78

18. Davis, 14.75

19. Swift, 14.48

20. Sanders, 14.38

One major takeaway I got from this is the difference in points per game between players at the top (Kamara, Cook) and players farther down is much greater. For instance, the difference between #1 and #10 is 8.9 while the difference between #10 and #20 is only 1.9. I like to think of it as a function, or mountain slope, where the drop in value starts off extremely steep and gradually levels out. In my honest opinion, I think it gives a good sense of what actually wins leagues, which is having players who are at the very top. You can have a team that's absolutely loaded with talent (both in the lineup and on the bench), but if they're facing a team with Kamara, Kelce, and Hill (and perhaps waiver wire players filling in the other slots) and their team lacks a league winning player, they will lose almost all of the time. You've also got to think of it like this: Your lineup is the only asset of your team that gets you fantasy points. Your bench can have as much depth as possible but won't contribute anything. If you want to win leagues, you need to trade up for the best possible pieces to have in your lineup. For instance, I would trade a starter and a bench player for one player who acts as a significant upgrade to that starter I traded. If you do this, you will have an amazing lineup and will dominate leagues.

Anyways, that's just my two cents whether or not you agree or disagree. I thought I'd share this.",fantasyfootball,1,1609590256,kowojk,1

Here are a couple floaters:

Weekly redrafted, like Draftkings etc. you d still be paired against an opponent each week. This would be different in that your opponent can have the same players as you. 

Keeper/Dynasty league, this area is new to me.  What are the differences? My main concern would be someone bailing on their team amd me having to find a replacement owner. 

Auction league, seems interesting and a fresh spin in waiver wire action. 

Best ball, I like this idea because injuries and ejections don‚Äôt play a part. 

I‚Äôm not looking for a definitive answer, but if you could chime in on pros/cons that‚Äôd be appreciated. Also, if you could please try to include things you wish you would have implemented or have implemented in leagues as a commish.",fantasyfootball,1,1609558995,koq1jy,1

0,Look at Total Points Scored and not just end-of-season rankings,BaldWeagle10,"As you begin to reflect over the 2020 fantasy season and to think about drafting in the fall, don‚Äôt just look at the final positional rankings. Make sure to check out Total Points Scored and Average Points Per Game as well. 

Here are a few interesting tidbits from PPR scoring. 

1.	The RB1 (Kamara) scored 128 more fantasy points this season (378 total) than the RB4 (Robinson), who scored 250 fantasy points. That‚Äôs a difference of 7 points per game. 

2.	The RB7-RB22 all scored between 214 and 170 fantasy points this season, a variance of less than two points per game.  

3.	The WR1 (Adams) scored 342 points this season and averaged 26 points per game once you account for his two games missed due to injury. The WR2 (Hill) and WR3 (Diggs) averaged 22 and 21 points per game respectively. 

4.	The WR15-WR28 all scored between 14.4 and 13.6 points per game. 

5.	When comparing RBs and WRs, notice that the WR20 scored the same number of fantasy points as the RB10 (208), the WR31 scored the same number of points as the RB14 (184), and the RB27 (153) finished within one point of the W40 (154). 

6.	The TE1 (Kelce) scored 313 fantasy points, while the TE2 (Waller) scored only 252 points. That‚Äôs a difference of 4 points per game. 

7.	The TE3-TE10 all scored between 170 and 142 fantasy points. That‚Äôs a variance of less than two points per game among the group, but it‚Äôs a minimum of 6 points per game less than Waller and a whopping 11 points per game less than Kelce! 

8.	The QB1 (Murray, 387) scored only 4 points per game more than the QB10 (Herbert, 310). After the QB 10, production drops off of a cliff. 

Key takeaways:

1.	Draft players in the earliest rounds who have a legitimate, proven shot at being top-tier elite at their position each year. Players like Adams, Hill, and Kelce were much more likely to win you your league than Josh Jacobs or Miles Sanders. 

2.	Prioritize WRs after the truly elite RBs (Kamara, McCaffery, Cook, maybe Henry, maybe Saquon) have gone off of the board, especially in leagues that start 3 WR or multiple flex spots. Your flex should almost always be a WR in PPR. And, in this case, you should likely fill your flex spot(s) before picking your second RB. This strategy will create the largest weekly advantage for your team, but also depends on league size. 

3.	Don‚Äôt reach at QB, but do reach to draft an elite TE. Owning Kelce this year created a greater weekly advantage than even Kamara could produce. Waller produced at the same rate as the WR8 (Jefferson). 

4.	Draft one of the last QBs you believe can finish as the overall QB1. He will almost certainly land within the top tier of QBs (QB1-QB10 this year). The player you draft instead of an early QB should create a larger weekly advantage than Kyler or Mahomes.

1. As of Week 16, I am the 10th highest scoring RB (0.5 ppr). 

2. I am not the primary running back on my team, and I'm generally considered to not be the best RB on my team. 

3. I scored more points in 2020 than Nick Chubb, Zeke Elliot, and Clyde Edwards-Helaire. 

4. My ADP was basically undrafted, maybe last round. 

5. I only had 2 games with double digit carries. 

6. Me and T.Y. Hilton caught the same number of TD passes from Philip Rivers.

WRs and flex: Lockett, Moore, MJJ, Hollywood Brown-&gt;Landry, Crowder, A. Brown, E. Sanders (I've cut all the former, while all the latter are from waivers)

RBs: Cook-&gt;Gibson (I drafted Gibson, cut him before week 1, but picked him up after week 1); Ekeler-&gt;Ekeler

My TE, DST, and K are all the same. Wallerus, Ravens, Dustin Hopkins (I had Koo, but fuck it, I'm going homer).

So that's 4 starters that are the same; 1 who's different but I drafted (Rodgers); one who's ALMOST like that (Gibson); and 4 who I got on waivers (WRs and flex).

56,Playoff FF Resources,TheChiefofReddit,"My friends and I are doing a Playoff FF league. In short, a player can be on two different teams (10 person league) and you only have the initial draft. If your player‚Äôs team loses in the playoffs, they are done and you do not redraft or pick up new players. The winning strategy is to pick the best players on a team/or teams you think will make a deep run in the playoffs. You get cumulative points for the entire playoff run. .5 PPR and traditional sized FF teams (nothing too funky).

Other than this subreddit, are there any other resources that will help me with my initial draft? Just trying to save time from looking up % of making it to SB with FF potential.

Thanks in advance.",fantasyfootball,1,1609514829,kod0c5,1

59,"Who was really a ""league winner"" in 2020?",BurgessFox,"We hear this phrase massively overused by fantasy analysts. In draft season, basically every RB handcuff gets touted as 'this guy could WIN YOU YOUR LEAGUE', also Dallas Goedert if Zak Ertz were ever to miss time, various late round QBs, second year break out WRs etc. It crops up on the waiver wire shows too especially when people start talking about stashes with good playoff schedules (Goff?).

So now we're just at the end of the season its a good time to look at what category of player *really* wins you your league. 

First, a few categories worthy of mention but I wouldn't say these were genuine league winners: 

***Category 1:*** **Good splash players in championship week/playoffs**

Gaskin, Jeff Wilson jr, David Johnson, Agholor, Crowder, Jimmy Graham, Irv Smith jr. 

These guys were probably either picked off waivers or carried unremarkably through the year on someone's roster but they weren't the reason the team made it that far.

***Category 2:*** **Mid/late round pick ups who gave 1st/2nd round performance**

J RB1inson, Jefferson, Rodgers, Waller. 

These guys almost certainly helped you to a playoff spot if the rest of your draft was decent, and Rodgers/Waller put up good performances in playoffs too. However, they probably weren't difference makers that could carry you through the season. I had one frustrating team with both Robinson and Jefferson that finished just outside the playoffs. 

***Category 3:*** **Season-long studs who had a big margin over most others in their position**

Cook, Henry, Hill, Kelce.

These guys could carry you to the playoffs and gave you enough consistent floor of performance to shore you up on a week to week basis as well as popping enough to win you several weeks. Given the injuries and failure of performance in other positions, these guys could have all justified a top 6 draft pick, and depending on when your draft was (eg Cook still talking about holdout), you may well have been able to pick all of them with a late 1st or 2nd rounder. 

But a true league winner for me is a player who combines being in that first category (popped in Championship week) with being one of the other two categories.

Two guys fit into Category 1 and 2: **Josh Allen** and **Stefon Diggs**. These were mid rounders (Josh Allen went quite late in some drafts) and maybe their owners picked them up because they 'fell to them' in the draft, they probably weren't guys you left your draft super happy with. Allen had accuracy issues, Diggs had the whole 'WR changing teams' thing plus had a record for being moody with Cousins so you could kinda see where this could end up. But they took a lot of teams to the Championship and probably that late Bills-Patriots game overturned a lot of deficits in peoples Championships.

Two guys fit into Category 1 and 3: **Alvin Kamara** and **Davante Adams**. Other than some brief barren spells (with Taysom Hill as QB, or through injury) these guys were season long studs who won several weeks during the season with mega high scores, and then did the same in the Championships. I haven't seen the stats showing who was on the most winning teams but I would guess that these two were the most likely guys to be your difference makers. 

So there we go, four players in my view class as genuine league winners in 2020. I guess I may have missed guys so open to any other arguments for inclusion from others etc. Happy New Year everyone.",fantasyfootball,1,1609506226,koaz6z,1

80,Time to reassess going zero RB,Sol-King,"It really just appears like RB getting injured and maybe even the severity of injury is more likely than a WR. There‚Äôs one RB for every 3 WR per snap. RBs do blocking running and catching. Running thru O line looks most dangerous with twisting ankles, breaking knees, and D lineman falling on top whereas WRs can have the luxury of running outta bounds if they play on the wing.  This year many of us had to endure Saquon out with season ending injury and literally every other RB out for multi week injuries. Idk if this year injury bug was especially bad cuz of short training. But now I‚Äôm thinking it time to draft WR and TE in first two rounds for security at the position. Yeah MT and Julio were bad this year but you got more games outta them than CMC Saquon Mixon Mostert Ekeler maybe Chubb and that‚Äôs not including this years duds like Zeke and Drake. With gems like James Robinson on waivers and just stacking up on RBs in the mid rounds and then playing the matchups this strat could be perfect for future szns.",fantasyfootball,1,1609476218,ko55ux,1

83,Some Postseason Stats,theWhinja,"Now that Week 16 has wrapped up and all (hopefully) stat corrections are in, I created a listing for the final rankings of all skill positions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Kau-NVN0EoRFkB8ML_DQCj4ZTCp7jxPWlJ6JIkV2P4/edit?usp=sharing).

This spreadsheet breaks down the Top-24 (12 for TEs) players for each position and their week-to-week play, including injured games. It also color-codes these weekly performances based on how it matched up against the overall statistics for all the games. If a game has an asterisk beneath it that means the player was removed mid-way through the game due to injury (I only put this in because of Diontae Johnson).

There is also a section to the right that includes a basic summary of each player: Min, Max, Average, Games missed to injury , Games scoring in the upper and lower echelons. This section is useful in determining how much better/worse a player is compared to the average as well as the relative floor of a player.

Hopefully this spreadsheet helps some people out. I posted a similar one a couple years ago and I've made a few changes since then and I'd love some feedback on it. I've also left some notes on certain players and cells throughout the document with my thoughts on these players or just some random things I noticed

*Now here is where I state some of my findings*

* Burrow is a stud. QB23 and he missed 5 games. No way he goes below that point next year. 
* Kelce is far and away the best TE in the league and better than most WRs (but that's obvious)
* ESPN is good at predicting the top 24 QBs, but suck at WRs
* 8 of the Top-12 RBs were ranked outside of the top 12; 5 of them ranked top 8; 2 of those never scored below 9.5 points; 1 of those was ranked below their backup: James Robinson",fantasyfootball,1,1609472960,ko4fuv,1

86,Charity donations,CriMxDelAxCriM,"Charity donations to players favorite charities is one of the greatest aspects of this hobby and one we should all encourage at every turn. Too often our community is looked down especially by players for our sometimes clinical and savage reactions to players poor performance or injuries. The best thing that can be done for our community is head lines like the one on yahoo sports about Kamara's supported charity getting a boom of donations for his league winning performance. 

We need to keep support stuff like that at every turn.  We should want players to feel good about fantasy football and we as a community should be looked up positively by outsiders for stuff like that. Keep it up guys.",fantasyfootball,1,1609465115,ko2l5e,1

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team‚Äôs matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you‚Äôre in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‚ÄòEm game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

**Please do not post screenshots of your matchups.**

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn‚Äôt give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

Had I made it, round one I scored 147 and would have easily beaten the 3 seed. Round two vs the 2 seed I would have score 142 to 112 making the championship game. In said game I scored 133 to the 1 seeds 115. I would have won $200. But nay I was slain by my week 13 foe. That foe went on to be the 3rd seed who beat the 6th, 2nd and the 1st seed to win our league back to back. Oh I know the woes of fantasy football. I shall rise again and take back my throne.

So the question I have for everyone is this: the last week I put in a waiver claim for AJ Dillon, as he wasn‚Äôt rostered and I figured I could put him on my roster and see how the off-season plays out, then possibly make him one of my keepers. 

Sleeper never processed that waiver claim and it still shows up as a claim on my roster. Is it shady to use my commissioner power to add him to my roster? Or is there a process (looking at waiver order, asking if anyone put in any claims etc) that should be followed? What would you guys do?",fantasyfootball,1,1609451267,knyso1,1

35,Fantasy League Efficiency,-dep-,"Im trying to determine how efficient a league is in capturing fantasy points. For example, in 2019 teams in our fantasy league scored a total of 20,000 fantasy points, and real life NFL players scored 80,000 points. Of 80,000 total points available, managers scored 20,000 = 25% captured (points on bench or waivers/FA are not captured).

Anyone ever look into this or know of a good resource for getting that 80,000 number? Im sure you could go through PFR page by page for that year ([https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm)) and manually compile everything and plug in your league's scoring and such, but frankly thats a lot of work and i dont want to do it if someone else already has.

Would this be valuable? Maybe you can use it as a measure to compare leagues in terms of competitiveness, or maybe its totally useless, but im curious either way",fantasyfootball,1,1609443661,knwktn,1

39,We're releasing a free app that optimizes your fantasy lineups using AI.,SportAI,"Hey everyone,

The team at SportAI is releasing a free app that optimizes your fantasy sports lineups using a highly effective AI we developed. We're a group of data scientists and developers that are obsessed with sports analytics, and we saw an issue: the fantasy sports industry is filled with gurus that sell their picks for ridiculous fees without explaining the quantitative reasoning. Our goal is to democratize fantasy sports by providing a free mobile app that uses data analytics to optimize your fantasy lineups, while providing visuals that help you understand the *why*. All you have to do is input your players and the opponents' players into the app each week and the AI will optimize your lineup + provide visual representations of the data that went into the analysis.

With the conclusion of the season, we're extremely excited to share the results of our original 30 testers who used SportAI throughout the season:

27/30 made the playoffs.

22/30 made the finals.

22/30 won their league.

And none of them paid a cent.

Additionally, we had been releasing weekly Breakout Picks to our newsletter for every position according to what SportAI told us. We ONLY trusted the numbers and injected zero subjective bias into the selections. These picks outperformed their ESPN/Yahoo projected PPR Points by an average of over 20% throughout the season.

We're really proud of SportAI's results in its first season of fantasy football, and we're gearing up to see how it performs during the NBA season in fantasy basketball. We're currently aiming for a March release of the app's private beta, which you can sign up for [HERE](https://sportai.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=b6ac61245dcf2d85acfd3db79&amp;id=d7eeb7070f). There are no catches and we do not solicit for payments. You can see other periodic updates on our [TWITTER](https://twitter.com/SportAIOfficial),  [INSTAGRAM](https://www.instagram.com/sportaiofficial/), and [FACEBOOK](https://www.facebook.com/SportAIOfficial/).

40,Trace McSorley: a Fantasy season in review,major-couch-potato,"Trace McSorley has gained in ownership each week, and is up to 1.4 percent in ESPN leagues as we near the end of the season.

Here‚Äôs a recap of his season:

**Week 1:** The Ravens won big, but McSorley still didn‚Äôt get to throw a pass

**Week 2:** Did not appear in a win over the Texans

**Week 3:** No chance to play in a loss to KC despite Lamar throwing for a paltry 97 yards.

**Week 4:** Did not get any opportunities in a win against Washington, even though Sam Koch and RGIII both attempted a pass.

**Week 5:** No appearance in a win against the Bengals.

**Week 6:** Ravens defeat Eagles, no appearance.

**Week 7:** Lamar threw 2 INTs in a loss to the Steelers, but Trace did not get a chance.

**Week 8:** No appearance in win over Colts.

**Week 9:** He did not get a chance to bring the Ravens to victory, as they lost by 1 TD to the Pats.

**Week 10:** No appearance, loss to Titans.

**Week 11:** Lamar was out due to COVID but RGIII still got the start for some reason. After he entered the game in replacement of Griffin, he was 2-for-6 for 77 yards, scoring 8.6 points. This was his best fantasy game of the season, and he proved that Griffin should not have started. If he had started, maybe RGIII wouldn‚Äôt have thrown a pick and gotten hurt, and the Ravens would have won.

**Week 12:** Did not enter the game in a W vs the Cowboys,

**Week 13:** After Lamar left with ‚Äúcramps‚Äù he was 1-for-4 for 13 yards and rushed twice for a yard, scoring 0.8 points. Unfortunately, he got hurt, killing his impact for the rest of the season.

**Weeks 14-17:** Missed due to being on IR.

**Conclusion:** Trace is the GOAT. He did not throw any picks this season and threw several dots. His 1.4% ownership is well deserved, he should be a high-end QB1 in any game he starts and a QB2 flier if he doesn‚Äôt, due to his ability to completely dominate if given a chance.",fantasyfootball,1,1609440400,knvla0,1

45,"Keeper leagues, who is your stash for 2021?",CaptainTrip5,"What are your leagues rules for keepers? Who are you thinking about keeping? Do you target your highest projected ADP player or high value late rounder?

2021 will be my leagues second keeper year, so strategy is a bit new to me. First time I chose Ekeler for this past year. I had drafted him pretty far into draft so value was good (RIP with injury though). Our league rules are that you can‚Äôt keep a first rounder, you lose your pick in the round one up from your keepers draft spot, and to keep a player you must have drafted him and held him all season. 

For me, this year Ekeler is tempting again as I would only lose a 3rd round pick, but I also snagged Diggs in the 5th (so I‚Äôd lose 4th round pick). Thinking I‚Äôm gonna keep Diggs.",fantasyfootball,1,1609439154,knv7sg,1

I‚Äôm pretty worried about starting Alvin Kamara, Aaron Jones, and Aaron Rodgers.

Both teams are fighting for the top seed in the NFC, but scoreboards exist. If either one of the two jumps out to a huge lead, I‚Äôd be worried about coaches starting to cycle in Murray, AJ Dillon, and possibly sitting ARod.

Who are you stressing about starting, even though they‚Äôre slated to start in their respective position?

I feel like that will take some of the joy out of things if I were to win the league, as no matter what happens my bank account is going to go down after the season ends.

* Conner gains 1 rushing yard.
* Because a play was wiped out because of penalty, for IND Rivers loses a passing attempt and completion, Hines loses the reception.
* CIN gains a forced fumble (but not recovered)
* Many random, small IDP changes

And per this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/knqb0u/stat_change_alert/), ESPN appears have flip-flopped again and is *not* counting [Steven Sims's muffed punt return (yielding a CAR TD)](https://www.nfl.com/videos/panthers-pounce-on-steven-sims-s-muffed-punt-for-td) as points against the WAS D/ST, thus reducing their points allowed from 20 to 14.

In the finals.  

Look: *either* rule is defensible (though to me, points scored against one's D/ST plainly *should* count here). The problem is that ESPN doesn't seem to have a rule on this, but changes its mind each time this comes up.",fantasyfootball,1,1609426757,knre14,1

My opponent has Josh Allen and was concerned he might sit this week and ended up picking up Kirk Cousins (I have Jefferson and Irv Smith this week) off waivers last night, but the issue I‚Äôm having is that he made that move while still having 2 non-IR eligible players in his IR which ESPN typically prevents you from making any acquisitions until those players are activated from your IR and knowing this I had moved Kirk farther down my priority list, but if I knew he could have still made moves I would have surely added him first/blocked him. 

For the record, he said he was able to submit the claim even when his players were still listed as Questionable so not the case of him making the claim while those players were still listed as out.

There is precedent for this type of rule on ESPN in 2019 [(maybe here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/ed2tcx/confused_about_49ers_stat_correction_week_15/) which appeared to state that these points SHOULD be counted against the D/ST since both ST units are on the field - so all was right in the world...until this morning...

&amp;#x200B;

They changed it back! So in our league with decimal D/ST scoring it amounted to a difference of +1.32 points and since our Championship was decided by less than 1 point, this has changed our winner 2 times now!

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team‚Äôs matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you‚Äôre in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‚ÄòEm game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

**Please do not post screenshots of your matchups.**

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn‚Äôt give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

15,Sell High Guys in Dynasty?,MikeSports22,"Which players on your dynasty teams are you looking to trade away?

For me the two guys I‚Äôm looking to move are Adam Thielen and Tim Patrick

Thielen will turn 31 years old before the start of next season and Justin Jefferson is a super star in the making. Between him and Dalvin Cook, Thielen could drop out of the top 24 WR range and into a flex option towards the end next season.

Patrick has a great season but it came in a contract year. He could be back with Denver next year but Courtland Sutton should return 100% and take back over that starting WR spot. Patrick could land somewhere nice in free agency but he‚Äôs not likely to see the target share he did this season.

I think he has top five upside in PPR, but I'm a little concerned that he wasn't a productive under Herbert as he was under Rivers. Is this a Herbert issue, play calling issue, or a 'he's not the one' issue?

Our league participates in a bonus Best Ball league on Yahoo.  Since the format hasn't incorporated custom leagues, and seeing as it's hard for 10 guys to get into the same draft, everyone sends me screenshots of their weekly scores, and I keep a spreadsheet to track weekly money prizes, as well as a season total payout.

Last year, we were able to look at ""past leagues"" and not only see season totals, but also go in and find individual weekly scores.  Now we can only see season totals.  Anyone know if this is just how it goes this year, or if it's a bug of some kind?  It's not a huge deal because I can figure week 16 scores based on season totals from week 15, but there are a few stat corrections throughout the season that might effect weekly wins.

That's it, another year in the books!  Congratulations to those who may have won a title and I do appreciate the following and all the feedback this year.

Please consider using this analysis as a quick reference guide in your draft prep for next season, always helps me!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Original Post for Reference:**

So what is this thing? I basically wanted to solve the mystery of ‚Äúseason average fantasy points per game‚Äù. With injuries and byes, you can never get a good look at the best fantasy players by total points, so I‚Äôm sure we all go and look at season average fantasy points per game to see who the best free agents are or to help decide sit/starts.

However I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve realized, there is an inherent problem when you do this. I've always mentally called it ‚ÄúDesean Jackson Syndrome‚Äù. You‚Äôve got two players you are comparing and they both are averaging 10 points a game through the first 3 weeks. However one of the guys scored 9, 10, &amp; 11 and the other guy scored 1, 25, &amp; 4 (Desean Jackson). The only way to know that this occurred is to click on each guy and look at the game logs, which is very annoying and time consuming.

Using pro-football-reference.com I was able to query the results of each player for each week and compile it all into one workbook. To make things simple and to match most of my leagues, I brought in fantasy points scored each week in a half-point PPR format. I then compared the points scored each week to the average in order to determine statistical dispersion, which basically is how far away do players stray from their average.

What you will find in the shared Google Drive PDF is the ability to determine the difference between consistent players or those that are boom-or-bust. You always hear, ‚Äúthat guy is reliable, he has a high floor‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust him, he‚Äôs boom-or-bust‚Äù, well now you can visually see those characteristics in the data.

Few things to keep in mind when you look at this:

* Fantasy points are shown with half-point PPR
* Anyone who hasn‚Äôt played in at least 50% of the weeks over any given period are filtered out
* Anyone who is averaging &lt;5 fantasy points are filtered out

71,NFL Week 17 Match-Up Tool For Every Game And Relevant Stats,DailyRotoHelp,"I know there are SOME people that are still playing in the championship during week 17. Good luck! If you're not but play DFS this can help as well!

What's in the Box?!

QB, RB, WR, TE, Red Zone Passes, Red Zone Rushes, and Red Zone Receptions. In each category, we have how many Fantasy Points Per Game the defense has given up, who their opponent is, and how many fantasy points per game the team has accrued so far in 2020. Along with that, we have every stat you need to find the perfect match-ups this weekend. Whether you're playing season-long or DFS, this matchup tool has the most stats that will help out. 

***We've moved this over to Google Sheets with a link above so you can open it on a webpage. There is literally no way to optimize this for mobile due to the fact of how many columns/stats are there. It's best to view it on a computer.***

If I happened to miss some players please let me know and I'll get them added.

With the Browns WRs out, and other players being ruled out, we have tried to update this as much as possible. I could have missed some players so let me know!

For me its J.J. Taylor from New England.  Bill Belichick compared him to Damien Harris in the sense that both had limited work as a rookie but Harris earned a bigger role in year 2 and that Taylor should do similar.

James White is a free agent this spring and likely won't be back. Cam Newton will be gone and the Patriots should have a quarterback who can throw. Expect the passing game to return in 2021 and Taylor to take over White's role as the passing down back.",fantasyfootball,1,1609350366,kn6uwm,1

However, i propose that you join the *unofficial r/ff Playofg Challenge group for the NFL.com playoff Challenge.  Below is the link to the group i created.  It is public so no password needed.

https://playoffchallenge.fantasy.nfl.com/group/432724

For those of you unfamiliar with the format,  first i would suggest taking a look at the ""How to Play"" link on the right side of the menu.

The TLDR is that you choose your players and each week they stay alive in the playoffs they get a multiplier to their points (up to 4x by the superbowl).  If the team your player is on loses, you choose a new player from a live team and they start back at 1X points.

Its a lot of fun and would be cool to post/talk on here about whos winning etc.",fantasyfootball,1,1609347873,kn61hr,1

8,2021 Sleepers,governorbutters,"What players do you all see going much lower than their actual value next year? I think injuries and coaching changes will play a role, so here's my list.

1. Barkley - top 3 talent, could fall to 12-15.
2. Kittle - top 2 TE, could end up in round 3 or behind Waller
3. Jeudy - rookie with terrible offense, shown flashes and still has nearly 800 yards this year. I'd peg his ADP for round 10 could get round 6 value.
4. Cam Akers - clearly the best Rams back as a rookie. If he moves into even a 2 down role, he could be a round 3 value in rounds 7-9.
5. Michael Thomas - he only played about 20 snaps at 100% this year. He was still the no. 1 target when Taysom played, and should get 150+ targets in a 17 game season next year. Could go round 4-5 and end up as a top 3 WR again.

37,V1per's Week 17 Survivor/Eliminator Pick,V1per41,"Who else out there is sweating right now. We are 16-0 with one week between us and victory. My personal league has 3 teams remaining with a likely 2 or 3 way chop.

No point in going into the same depth as usual since there is only one game to consider. It's as simple as picking the team with the largest spread that you still have available. Luckily for this thread, right now, that team is IND -- the team with the largest current spread of the week at -14. That gives us an 89% chance to go undefeated for the season.

If you don't have IND available the next best options in order would be:

BAL

CLE (!?)

TEN

MIN

Make sure you check the lines before you submit your pick this week. With teams resting starters, the lines get a bit funky -- Just look at PIT being a 10 point underdog to CLE next week.

Otherwise, congrats to those of you who have already won your league, and good luck to those of us who have to fade one more huge upset.

**Season Review**

When I made the week 1 post I said that we had a 0.8% chance of going undefeated. In reality it was a bit higher than that. As we went through the season win probabilities increased for future games as we learned more about each team. Taking the Sunday morning spreads for the whole season our probability of going undefeated was 3.1% -- about a 1 in 33 chance. On average we should have expected to lose 3 games -- Which we almost did. 2 Games went to OT, one of which needed a last second FG attempt to bounce off the uprights to even get there.

Some fun data slices:

Favorite teams to pick against:

|Team|Picks against|
|:-|:-|
|JAX|6|
|NYJ|5|
|CIN|2|
|CAR|1|
|LAC|1|
|NYG|1|
|WSH|1|

No surprise here, JAX, and NYJ were the two most popular teams to pick against.

&amp;#x200B;

Picks by Division

|AFC East|3|
|:-|:-|
|AFC North|3|
|NFC North|3|
|NFC South|2|
|NFC West|2|
|AFC West|2|
|AFC South|1|
|NFC East|1|

We managed to pick at least one team from each division. Yes, including the NFC east when we took the Giants in week 12 over Cincinnati.

&amp;#x200B;

Best team we didn't pick: Tennessee Titans -- Currently ranked 10th on 538

Worst team we did pick: New York Giants -- Currently ranked 28th on 538

Biggest Favorite: Week 8: KC over NYJ: -19.5

Smallest Favorite: Week 12: NYG over CIN: -6.5

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I make these posts purely because I love the math and programming involved with developing and running the algorithm every week. I also love seeing the conversation the develops around the different league variants and how that changes the best pick each week.

While the odds are long that I go undefeated in a season I feel that my methods do give me an advantage so I go for it. Last season I had 3 losses by week 13, this year we happened to get really lucky.

40,Did anyone on this sub actually draft James Robinson? Starting to think I might be the only one...,jbud3570,"Every single time I see Robinson invoked here, it is always ‚Äúpickup of the year‚Äù or ‚Äúbest waiver move ever.‚Äù And I always get a little smile on my face, because I was a lucky duck that actually drafted him (in a keeper league, no less!). I have literally not seen one singular mention of anyone having drafted him (I scoured the sub‚Äôs post history), so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else did too, and if so: how? why? And congrats!

The news had just broken that Fournette was signing with the Bucs. For some reason, very late in the draft, after I‚Äôd solidified my starters and base bench guys, I was trying to make a few gambles. The thought occurred to me: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to be the 1 in Jacksonville now?‚Äù 

I googled ‚ÄúJaguars RB depth chart.‚Äù Robinson came up as RB1 on ESPN. The best part about it was he didn‚Äôt even have a photo on there yet ‚Äî just that black placeholder silhouette. 

It‚Äôs not like I was super confident about that offense, but hey, a starting RB is a starting RB. Took a flier on him in the 13th round, and the rest is history. I‚Äôm in a keeper league, so I‚Äôm pretty pumped to slot him in next year.",fantasyfootball,1,1609341954,kn46ao,1

42,Learn Python with Fantasy Football Giveaway!,NukishPhilosophy,"Hi all,

[I recently created a course on learning Python with Fantasy Football for complete beginners.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com)

For those that don't know, Python is a beginner-friendly programming language that's really popular for data analysis. As a first programming language, it's a perfect fit for a beginner who wants to learn a programming language and is obsessed with fantasy football. 

The overall goal of my course is to introduce coding to you through a fun and engaging topic you all enjoy, fantasy football. A lot of people have reported back to me that this course was the thing that finally got programming to ""click"" for them after going through countless udemy courses and e-books. I don't think that's because I'm the best coding educator out there. There's some great ones out there, especially on YouTube (Brad Traversy, Cody Schafer, etc). I think it's because the best, fastest, and most pleasant way to learn to code is to apply it to something you enjoy and can be useful to you right away. For example, most beginner machine learning with Python courses introduce you to predictive analysis by having you predict housing prices. That's fine, but wouldn't it be more interesting and engaging to get introduced to predictive analysis by predicting WR fantasy football performance? 

With this in mind, each section of my course has some sort of fantasy football focus, all along the way introducing you to more and more complex programming/data science topics. My course walks you through the set up of Python, all the way to writing machine learning models to rank players in to tiers for fantasy football. It comes with 16 sections of material, 14 hours of video, and access to a Slack channel where you can personally ask me questions when you get stuck (I work from home, so I usually respond within a couple minutes to 2 days max).

Anyway - you all have been super supportive of my content [since my first ever post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/en8xte/guide_to_setting_up_python_for_fantasy_football/), so I figure why not do a giveaway to mark the end of the season! Just upvote and comment your interest below, and I'll randomly select three people to get free lifetime access to the course.",fantasyfootball,1,1609341530,kn41qn,1

In League 2, I scored fairly well in the playoffs, but I lost two weeks in a row to a guy I beat twice in the regular season (he had guys get season high points).

Then we started talking about the 2019 Pats of course and the 2012 Bears who I'm guessing were 2 of the best ever. That being said, can anyone help me find somewhere that has season totals for defenses all time? I've been looking for like an hour and the most I've found only goes back to 2012. The single game fantasy scores went back to like the 50's for defenses, why is it seemingly impossible for me to find yearly totals going back before 2012? I'd even settle for a top 25 at this point if there really isn't anything else out there. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

If you wanna have some fun with it, tell me who you think is the highest scoring fanatsy defense in an entire season.

This is all done by hand, I have no idea how to make a program to figure this out, and there might be a configuration that might be slightly better, but  from all the swapping in and out, this is the best draftable team I could create.

For scoring, I went with Yahoo standard 10 team, .5 ppr (1 qb, 2rb/wr, 1 te, 1 flex, 1 DST, 1 kicker, 6 benches) because that's what I had access to. I took this from position 4, as Kamara was the top scoring W/R/T, and with an ADP of 4.7, and Kamara had a pre-rank of 4.

13,Fantasy MVPs at each position,Brady12Gronk87,"Subject for interpretation for sure, just not in my mind. 

QB: Aaron Rodgers- MVP season and has been steady all year. Midway through, I would've been shocked if it wasnt Mahomes or Wilson, but Rodgers was a TD machine. Aaron Jones got fucked multiple times because Rodgers/Adams inside the five were wizards, but I'm not bitter. 

Mahomes and Josh Allen almost get it. Mahomes just because people drafted Lamar over him. This was obviously warranted, but there wont be a QB in fantasy drafted over Mahomes again for (at least) the next five years.  Allen went off all season and a lot of people traded him midseason. Another reason why looking ahead at schedules/matchups for anything but defense will only influence bad decisions. 

RB: Alvin Kamara- I get most would put James Robinson for obvious reasons, or Dalvin Cook. Cook finally stayed healthy outside of one game before the bye and he wasnt just (his usual) steady with big plays here and there. He had some monster games. Not only did he stay healthy, but outside of Henry (another option) he lead the league in rushes per game. 

But, Kamara scored 6 tds in the championship. Game set match right there in 99% of leagues. And when this dude gets 20+ touches, he simply goes off. Next level talent and though Latavius/Taysom still interfered, Kamara showed what happens when he gets the ball consistently and he did it in the finest of finales. Plus, he didnt miss a game. Him and Henry somehow weaved through the madness and that almost makes his lack of touches worth it at times. 

WR: Stefon Diggs- My man went for under $10 in multiple auctions this year. He averaged probably $17 and a 5-7th round pick in 12 team leagues and averaged of 20 pts in PPR. Ended with a brutal schedule and outdid what he has done all year. 

TE: Travis Kelce- Kelce was simply dominant. Every year he is, but he took it to another level this season. Would've never told you to draft him if I saw what Tyreek Hills stats would be this year. Crazy. But he still was a 2nd round pick and unless you draft well or get some good RBs on free agency, your team is largely reliant on him at times. But this year, RBs and TEs were a shitshow everywhere and having this dude getting 20-25 a game, every game, at the worst position by a mile, damn. But waller was an absolute league winner this year if you made the playoffs. I almost put him solely due to this. 

K: Younghoe Koo- Went undrafted in most leagues, I assume. Absolutely dominant but he did have a rough fantasy playoffs introduction. Hope he figures it out next year because I'm paying $3 for him in every auction league. Stud.

D/ST: None- A bit lazy to look at official scoring but every defense had periods of rough stretches. A lot of teams had bad stretches all year but even the Steelers, Ravens and Dolphins had untimely stretches. Ravens came through with their week 15 and 16 easy matchups, but they were not good at all for most of the second half. Steelers were so dominant in the first half though. They pattern NE from last year but with less polarizing results.",fantasyfootball,1,1609287522,kmqm7k,1
14,How much to tip League Commish?,wkane1012,"In a normal 12 team league with $200 buy ins. I won $1,600 for 1st place. What is the proper amount to tip the commish? He really doesn‚Äôt do a ton other then collecting our Venmos and setting a draft date.",fantasyfootball,1,1609287483,kmqlsm,1

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

After the Week 14 debacle against the Bills where he dropped several balls and was benched for the entire half, he bounced back with 8 receptions in both games, and two touchdowns, one being a 39 yard bomb

Not to mention that for his ADP, he was an absolute steal, especially in bigger leagues. Was able to grab him at the beginning of the 8th round and he is easily a WR2 with WR1 upside. An overall glance at his season shows that he's had 85 receptions, 828 receiving yards, and about 140 targets along with 7 touchdowns. Not to mention that he missed a game, left two games with injuries early on, and of course the game where he was benched. Taking out these games, he has 20 PPR in 7 out of 11 games.

To add on, his game is just beautiful to watch, the routes he runs are fantastic and he's overall very shifty. Thanks for the great season, definitely hope I can draft him again next year!",fantasyfootball,1,1609281942,kmow1s,1

37,Commissioner from work league won‚Äôt give back entry fee,SixStarStunna,"Hey everyone

Like the title says, I entered a league with my old company and paid a $50 entry fee before the season started. I played for two weeks and then I ended up leaving the company for a better position. The commissioner kicked me without telling me, which isn‚Äôt a problem for me I just wanted my money back. When I reached out to him, he said he was ‚Äúwaiting on two other people to pay him‚Äù before he would send my money back. Doesn‚Äôt make sense what that has to do with my money, but I told him okay. 

I asked for an update in the past month and he never replied. Just asked again as the season is over and still nothing. Sent him a Venmo request which is what I sent him the money on, and he denied it. He clearly is trying to pocket my money.

Is there anything I can do to get my money back? It‚Äôs only $50 but it‚Äôs the principal that I did nothing to this guy and he‚Äôs stealing from me. 

Any help would be great. Thanks for help in advance",fantasyfootball,1,1609281109,kmomlh,1

Oof, this is not so easy!  But here you go, an all-in-one attempt to put together the current outlook for week 17.  I know my results don't match expectations, and this can very well be due to certain assumptions about who is sitting and who is not.

For those unfamiliar, you set a lineup out of all players on playoff teams and you get a multiplier for every additional week they are in your lineup. So if a player's team advances, you get 2x their fantasy points in the divisional round, 3x in the conference championship, and 4x in the Super Bowl. The strategy involves balancing the best fantasy producers with the teams you think will advance far in the playoffs. It gets interesting with the concept of taking a 0 in round one of teams with a bye. It's a great mix of real game prognostication and all-star fantasy.

Write some notes for your future self. You might think you will remember situations /players  next August but that is just not feasible.

Take a screnshot of your 2020 lineups.  Most platforms might give you your final lineup but it would be good for you to see your week by week tendencies.  Did you have too much fodder on your bench you didnt move from soon enough?  do you see yourself playing a WR or RB on the FLEX more often than not?

Fot those with FAAB settings, export  week by week waiver reports.  If the league is to play next year you'd have tendencies you could use to your advantage

Keep a list of analysts you trust so you can go back to them next year.

16,Performances of the Season!,MasonDuhon,"Now that (most) championships are done, let‚Äôs take a look back and reflect on the best offensive, defensive, and positional performances in a single game this season.

Best DEFENSIVE performance: Haason Reddick in Week 14 with 43 Points

Reddick came to play against the G-men. Their offensive line has been struggling as of late and the fourth-year man out of Temple showed it. In only 60 minutes he posted 5 tackles, 2 TFLs, 3 FF, and 5 sacks for a loss of 43 yards.

Best OFFENSIVE performance: Tyreek Hill in Week 12 with 57.9 Points

Hill and Mahomes must‚Äôve done some sort of mind meld for the first half, where he put up over 200 yards in that half alone. The Bucs secondary was porous, allowing him to post a statline of 13 catches for 269 yards and 3 receiving touchdowns.

Let‚Äôs get into some positional breakdowns.

Best QB performance: Patrick Mahomes in Week 3 with 40 points

The only quarterback to account for 40+ points all season. Mahomes torched Baltimore, going 31-of-42 for 385 Yards, 4 TDs, and 0 picks.

Best RB performance: Alvin Kamara in Week 16 with 56.2 points

Not only is this the best RB performance this season, it‚Äôs actually the second best offensive performance this season and the third highest EVER for a RB. He posted 155 rushing yards, 3 receptions for 17 yards, and he tied an NFL record 6 rushing TDs. An absolute clinic by AK-41.

Best WR Performance: Tyreek Hill in Week 12 with 57.9 points. I‚Äôve already talked about this one so let‚Äôs mention the second-best.

Honorable mention: Tyler Lockett in Week 7 with 53 points

Russ was cooking and Lockett was serving Arizona for an hour. Even though they didn‚Äôt come out on top, Lockett had a monster night with 15 receptions for 200 yards and 3 TDs.

Best TE Performance: Darren Waller in Week 13 with 45 points

Boy did the jets defense let Waller tear them up. Having started him this week, I was super pleasantly surprised to get the benefit of this one. This is among the top-5 all time games for a TE ever. Carr connected with Waller a total of 13 times for 200 yards and 2 touchdowns.

Now the fun stuff: Kickers, Defenses, and IDP players!

Best K Performance: Stephen Gostkowski in Week 3 with 25 points

1 XP made, none missed. He made 6 kicks, and 3 of them were from 50+, making them worth 4 points each. Know who else had 25 points in Week 3? James Conner and Ryan Fitzpatrick. Not bad.

Best DEF Performance: The Patriots in Week 13 with 29 points

Stellar effort by Bill Belicheck and his guys against the Chargers. Only 258 yards allowed, 1 Touchdown by the defense, 3 sacks, 2 INTs, and  a Blocked Kick. What a way to pitch a shutout in a 45-0 win.

Best DL Performance: Joey Bosa in Week 12 with 39(!) points

Oh. My. God. Joey Bosa just made the entire Bills line disappear this day when he decided to be a human freight train. 8 Tackles, 1 Assisted tackle, 6 TFLs, 3 sacks for a loss of 17 yards, 1 PD, and a Fumble Recovery. He had Josh Allen shivering in his boots for about a quarter and a half.

Best LB Performance: Haason Reddick in Week 14 with 43 points.

25,"Week 17 D/ST and kicker projections, using weighted formulas in Excel to factor in recent performance and upcoming opponent",eink21,"**Background:** For most of this season, I've been posting an Excel file that factors in fantasy points scored and fantasy points given up by each upcoming opponent (and which assigns weights to account for recency as well as the degree to which each team plays up/down to their opponents).

**Important note:** These projections are generated purely from a mathematical model. **I don't make any manual adjustments or judgment calls** due to weather, coaching decisions, personnel changes, recent news, etc. Therefore, I would advise for you to **not rely solely on these projections**, but to instead check out some other people's projections as well. (For example, [/u/subvertadown](https://www.reddit.com/u/subvertadown/) posts weekly projections that he puts a lot of time, thought, and statistical analysis into.)

31,Fantasy Flashback: The Top 20 Championship Week Performances 2010-2020,thedevydirtbag,"The 2020 fantasy football playoffs have come and gone. If you survived week 16 and arose victorious, congrats, Champ. If you weren‚Äôt so fortunate, keep at it. Dust yourself off and come back even stronger next season.

In a season as chaotic as 2020 has proven to be, even making the playoffs was an achievement, let alone winning the whole thing. Week 16 of this season proved to be equally chaotic and incredible.

This week alone gave us five of the greatest individual performances on Championship Week since 2010.

That‚Äôs 25% of the following list.

So, with fantasy football‚Äôs regular season now finished, and the year coming to a close, let‚Äôs take a look back at the very best week 16 performances of the past decade; to remember the incredible performances that won championships for so many.

These point totals will reflect PPR, 6-point passing TD, and -2 points per fumble scoring. All statistics in this article were pulled from Pro Football Reference and Stathead.

Now, without further ado: The Top 20 Championship Week Performances 2010-2020!

20. Andy Dalton, QB, Cincinnati Bengals, 2013

363 YD, 4 TD; 10 RuYD **(39.52 fantasy points)**

Shoutout to the 2020 version of Andy Dalton, who rewarded his fantasy managers with an unexpected 32.6 point performance in week 16. This wasn‚Äôt the first time he came up big in the biggest game of the year, however. In 2013, Dalton led the Bengals to a dominant 42-14 win over the Minnesota Vikings. Cincy would go on to win the AFC North in 2013 at 11-5.

19. Josh Freeman, QB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 2010

237 YD, 5 TD; 23 RuYD, 1 FUM **(39.78)**

Freeman may have been a flash in the pan in the earlier part of this decade, but he put up a couple quality fantasy seasons during his brief career. In a game where Freeman led his Buccs to a huge win over the Seattle Seahawks in a 38-15 blowout, he also led his fantasy managers to victory on the biggest stage of the year.

18. Peyton Manning, QB, Denver Broncos, 2013

400 YD, 4 TD **(40.00)**

In a year where Manning broke records with 5477 passing yards and 56 total touchdowns, let‚Äôs just say he came up big for his managers more than once before this fantasy championship week gift. The Broncos would easily defeat the Houston Texans 37-13 in this game. Manning would go on to be named First-Team All-Pro, Offensive Player of the Year, and MVP.

17. Mike Evans, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 2020

10 REC, 181 YD, 2 TD **(40.10)**

As an Evans manager, I understand how frustrating it has been to have him on your roster this season. His usual highs and lows have never been more unpredictable and he never seemed to fully get on the same page as Tom Brady. However, it seems they got it figured out just in time for the championship, and Evans‚Äô managers were rewarded handsomely for sticking with him.

16. Josh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills, 2020

320 YD, 4 TD; 35 RuYD **(40.30)**

The changing of the guard in the AFC East is official. Buffalo relegated the New England Patriots to second-class citizen status in the division they once ruled with an iron fist, defeating them 38-9. Allen, in his third season, has developed into the best young quarterback in the game not named Patrick Mahomes, and took that next step into superstar territory.

15. Russell Wilson, QB, Seattle Seahawks, 2014

339 YD, 2 TD; 88 RuYD, 1 TD **(40.36)**

Wilson historically tends to come up big in week 16, but his biggest performance of them all came in 2014 when he dismantled the hapless Arizona Cardinals, who got blown out 35-6 in this game, en route to a 12-4 season where Seattle won the NFC West. Of course, they eventually lost to the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. At least Wilson‚Äôs managers won their‚Äôs.

14. Deshaun Watson, QB, Houston Texans, 2018

339 YD, 2 TD; 49 RuYD, 2 TD, 1 FUM **(40.46)**

Even though Nick Foles and the Philadelphia Eagles came out victorious in this match, 32-30, Watson put up one of the best performances in recent memory. In just his second season, back when people still believed Bill O‚ÄôBrien was a good coach, the star QB led his team to an 11-5 record, winning the AFC South, and I‚Äôd wager quite a few fantasy Super Bowls.

13. Tony Romo, QB, Dallas Cowboys, 2012

416 YD, 4 TD **(40.64)**

It‚Äôs easy to forget how good some players were, and Romo is one of those players for me. Doing this research today reminded me of how awesome of a quarterback the former undrafted free agent turned out to be. Despite one of Romo‚Äôs finest performances, the Cowboys unfortunately came up short against the New Orleans Saints in this one, losing 34-31.

12. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers, 2010

404 YD, 4 TD; 26 RuYD, 1 FUM **(40.76)**

When it comes to week 16 greatness, Rodgers is king. This is merely the first of a whopping four appearances he made on this list. This is also a season that ended with a Packers Super Bowl win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as Rodgers being named Super Bowl MVP. Green Bay would defeat the New York Giants in this late December game, 45-17.

11. Stefon Diggs, WR, Buffalo Bills, 2020

9 REC, 145 YD, 3 TD **(41.50)**

While Josh Allen will get most of the glory for Buffalo‚Äôs huge win over New England, Diggs was quietly the player of the game. The Allen-Diggs connection has been special all season. And Diggs is a special player who saved his greatest performance of the season for a week where the most eyes would be on him. I can‚Äôt wait to see what these guys have in store for the playoffs.

10. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers, 2011

283 YD, 5 TD; 18 RuYD **(43.12)**

Talk about an encore performance. Rodgers did it even bigger in 2011 than he did in 2010. This year wouldn‚Äôt end in another Super Bowl victory for the Packers, but it almost certainly did for Rodgers‚Äô fantasy managers. Who was the unfortunate team at the receiving end of this statistical beat down on Christmas? Divisional rivals, the Chicago Bears, who lost 35-21.

9. Davante Adams, WR, Green Bay Packers, 2020

11 REC, 142 YD, 3 TD **(43.20)**

Adams, who just turned 28 on December 24, celebrated his birthday and Christmas in style, not only helping defeat the Tennessee Titans 40-14, but also by helping his fantasy managers get the W in their biggest game of the year. With this clinic he put on, Adams has officially surpassed Tyreek Hill as the #1 receiver in fantasy, despite missing two games to an injury.

8. Dez Bryant, WR, Dallas Cowboys, 2012

9 REC, 224 YD, 2 TD **(43.40)**

Someone had to catch all the passes Tony Romo was throwing in this game. If you played the Romo-Bryant stack on this particular day, you laughed your way to the bank as your team won the league championship walking away. As a side note, it‚Äôs really cool to see Dez catching touchdowns again here in 2020. He has worked hard to get back, hopefully he can stick for a while.

7. Saquon Barkley, RB, New York Giants, 2019

189 YD, 1 TD; 4 REC, 90 YD, 1 TD **(43.90)**

If anyone needed a reminder of how great Barkley can be, let this serve as one. In the midst of an injury-riddled 2019 season, Barkley rounded back into form and then some just in time for the holidays to give his managers the gift of a league-winning performance against the Washington \*Name Redacted\*. The G-Men won this contest 41-35.

6. Antonio Brown, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers, 2018

14 REC, 185 YD, 2 TD **(44.50)**

It feels like it has been so long since we saw AB torching defenses like this. It‚Äôs amazing to see how much things can change in just a couple short years. The Steelers may have lost the battle in this one, falling to the New Orleans Saints 31-28, but Brown‚Äôs fantasy managers won the war, cashing in on this incredible effort.

5. Adam Thielen, WR, Minnesota Vikings, 2016

12 REC, 202 YD, 2 TD; 4 RuYD **(44.60)**

A star was born on Christmas Eve of 2016 when Thielen, still living in relative obscurity, burst onto the fantasy football scene with a career day against the Green Bay Packers. It saddens me to think about how many leagues Thielen was a free agent in when he did this. The Vikings would lose this game 38-25, but the select few who took a chance on Thielen certainly won.

4. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers, 2016

347 YD, 4 TD; 13 RuYD, 1 TD **(45.18)**

For those of you keeping count, this is only Mr. Rodgers‚Äô third appearance on this list. This also happens to be the very same game referred to in the Thielen blurb. It was quite a contest to give us two of the top five very finest week 16 fantasy performances of the decade. Rodgers finished the season with 40 touchdown passes, #1 in the league.

3. Aaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers, 2018

442 YD, 2 TD; 32 RuYD, 2 TD; 2PT **(46.88)**

In a 44-38 shootout victory over the New York Jets, Rodgers delivered the greatest fantasy Super Bowl performance of his spectacular career. He may never have the actual Super Bowl wins that Tom Brady has or Drew Brees‚Äô numbers, but Rodgers is the undisputed GOAT of fantasy championship week. He‚Äôs a baaaaad man.

2. Todd Gurley, RB, Los Angeles Rams, 2017

118 YD; 10 REC, 158 YD, 2 TD **(49.60)**

How the mighty have fallen. Now on his way to becoming a mere footnote in football history, Gurley, at his peak, was one of the best running backs of his era. He will be fondly remembered for performances such as this championship week gem where he practically single-handedly defeated the Tennessee Titans 27-23, along with those unfortunate enough to play against him.

1. Alvin Kamara, RB, New Orleans Saints, 2020

155 YD, 6 TD; 3 REC, 17 YD **(56.20)**

In a performance that will go down in fantasy football lore, Kamara‚Äôs Christmas Miracle was the greatest week 16 showing of any in the 2010-2020 era, as he carried his team to a 52-33 win over the Minnesota Vikings. I predict his favorite charity will see a sharp increase in donations in the near future with all those championship dollars he just won for his fantasy managers.

As someone whose team you helped win a championship, thank you, Mr. Kamara.

33,Question on ESPN's 5th/6th place game in final standings,ThisAintItChieftain,"In a 6-team playoff, the 2 guys who were knocked out in Round 1 (week 14) played each other to determine 5th place in week 15 and 16. Team A won week 15, Team B won week 16. ESPN declared team B the 5th place team.

So it appears that week 15 is meaningless for the 5th/6th place standings?",fantasyfootball,1,1609263581,kmiwsz,1

36,Deadline for Yahoo Fantasy Football Stat Corrections?,etheraider,"Anyone have any idea when all the stat corrections will be in for Week 16? Right now only 8 stat corrections are showing up for the week (there are normally 30+ on any given week) Im in a league with IDP's and the league championship is being decided by a margin of less than .5 points!

Would like to know if/when stat corrections are finalized completely.

So far the Yahoo Stat Corrections website says:

The following player statistical changes were made on Monday, December 28, 2020. 

So they havent made any changes since yesterday.

Anyone have more info?

37,What where unpopular moves you made during the season that ended up paying off?,YA4830,"This forum has been a boon and a bane in so many ways. Links to amazing pre-draft resources, weekly match-ups and the latest news for players and teams. Not to mention dealing with all this COVID craziness.

That being said, this sub has also been a knee jerk of sorts with the hot takes, ""league winners"" and quick to judgement reactions people give to others for their insights/analysis/transactions. 

I try to be insightful when I respond to others but I'm also guilty of the group biases. 

My biggest ""reaction"" post was when I traded Kamara one week after his Week 3 apocalyptic performance in prime time against the Packers when he scored me 50+. *(\*netted Diggs/Jackson/CEH)*

Some comments ATT were... 

* *""awful, awful trade""*
* *""Obviously Kamara isn't going to get 10+ targets a game with Slant Boy coming back. But, at the same time Brees isn't launching that ball down the field anytime soon. Unless I was hurting at WR and QB, I wouldn't do that trade.""*
* *""Yeah horrible trade""* 
* *""that's not how sell high works""*

41,Shoutout Le‚ÄôVeon Bell for the worst fantasy season in history,IAmADopelyLitSavage,"All of us who drafted him wasted our pick. Got injured his first week on the field so screws us who started him week 1. Proceeded to miss the next 3 weeks. Went to Kansas City, where he proceeded to continue not only being completely ineffective, yet in the process, destroyed helaires value so he screwed over his extremely high drafters as well. The one week helaire was out against the Broncos, we got to start him where he again proceeded to do jack shit as the lead runner. 

And then finally, his magnum opus, helaire gets injured and maybe, just maybe, he can be lead runner and win you a championship in week 16. Maybe you held him all year just for this moment, 15 weeks taking up a bench spot and he‚Äôll finally pay off.

Puts up 30 rushing yards and 1 catch for 9 yards, and still ended up being the backup behind Darrell Williams.

Thank you for your service in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017",fantasyfootball,1,1609261448,kmi7we,1

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

54,ALL LETTER TEAM WEEK 16,rdavis45,"Hello redditors of r/fantasyfootball. For the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been keeping track of which players with the same first letter of their last name have done the best, for funI was thinking of posting here, and decided what better week to start than week 16! Anyway I hope you all enjoy!

An idea that crossed my mind is rather than wait until the next fantasy season, why not think of what we can do now? Sure some will enjoy watching football without caring about the points, but for me I don't want to stop now that the playoffs time is up which should spike up the intensity of the sport. Thus, I don't want to miss out on all of the fun. 

Was looking at DraftKings and saw the private league option. Perhaps we can set up a league on there with relatively low entry fees (for shits and giggles) and maybe a big-baller league for those with ""go big or go home"" mantra. Not sure if this has been posted before or not. I'm a newbie as I just created an account and think it'll be quite fun to incorporate this community and to further our passion for fantasy

Because things change so drastically on a week to week basis in the NFL, I wanted to see how the matchups looked using a three week window. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on feedback from last season, I am now looking an extra week back for teams that have had a BYE week in the last 3 weeks.

**Here's the results for Week 17:**

&amp;#x200B;

**How to read the chart:** This data is showing the amount of points allowed, so if you‚Äôre looking at QBs, the Detroit Lions are allowing a lot of PPG in the last 3 weeks (good matchup for Kirk Cousins) while the Seattle Seahawks are not (bad matchup for C.J. Beathard).

Green = good matchup, Yellow = average matchup, Red = bad matchup.

The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.

The teams in the Prev 3 Opponents column are the teams that the team on the left has played in the last 3 weeks.

* **D/ST - New York Jets - 5% - 9**
* **K - Austin Seibert - CIN - 0% - 14**

This team is available in 87.56% of leagues and would've scored 137.34 points. Would this have won any of your leagues? I hope none of you have week 17 championships but if you do, perhaps this helps. 

Bengals! Get your Bengals here! I don't remember a time when we've had 4 players from the same team on the list. It's especially surprising given they were led by a 3rd string QB. Brandon Allen scored well against a middling Texans Defense. No one should be trusting him in a week 17 championship.

Perine could be an interesting option in deep dynasty leagues. He could become the RB2 there behind an oft injured Mixon. He probably isn't an option against the Ravens in week 17.

Wait, Kyle Juszczyk day was two weeks ago. He's back again this time with 2 TDs instead of one.  That just tells me Jeff Wilson could've had an even bigger day. 

Pascal had another decent game. He's getting quite a few targets and seems to be a decent dart throw most weeks. Against JAX next week he could be a good option. 

Braxton Berrios showed up for the first time in awhile. He got 3 targets on only 10% of snaps. That is a high number of targets for such a low snap share. He capitalized with a TD as well. You don't need me to tell you that Jets shouldn't be trusted in championship games.

Lee Smith is way down the depth chart. I keep waiting for Dawson Knox to break out but he hasn't yet, perhaps he'll breakout next year in year 3. In the meantime, it seems the only pass catcher to trust in BUF is Diggs, and really who else is needed, right?

Alex Erickson played 82% of snaps and caught all 6 targets. All of those were season highs. He got his opportunity with Boyd out and played well. 

The Jets made the list again. I can take solace in the fact that their ownership didn't increase. 

Seibert played well in place of Randy Bullock, missing on FG but knocking in 7 kicks.

# Accuracy for Week 16 -- and the Season

Week 16 luckily provided a very good level of predictability-- both overall *and* for my model relative to others'.  This was similar to week 15, which makes it even luckier.  This was a great way to end the season.  For week 16, **every** position was of above average predictability.  (Historically, the finals and the semis are not always this kind.)

&amp;#x200B;

In relative terms (reported below), the news was also good for my models specifically: My **D/ST was #1** for the week (*#1 for the season*), my **Kicker** was #2 for the week (*#1 for the season*), and **QB** was among the top 4 (#2 for season, and... #1 for weeks 4-10-- more detail on this, below).

&amp;#x200B;

[Summary of accuracy correlation coefficients for all models](https://preview.redd.it/e7iqiz9cl4861.jpg?width=819&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c39df6ac9d180aea0f3ad674d1bf2f0d20a41b2)

Looking at the above bar chart for all my models:

* D/ST, QB, WR, and TE all seemed to meet or exceed expectations, over the course of the season.
* Kicker, game-score, and RB possibly could benefit from some off-season improvements-- removing overfit or adding better variables/data.  
   * However, as I've highlighted many times before: 2020's increase in passing TDs could also be the reason for lower predictability for these models.  So room for improvement might be limited.  Stay tuned!

# 

# Accuracy for D/ST, Kicker, and QB

As you'll recall, the rest of my accuracy report is *comparative* (relative to other sources).  If you're new to this report: Before the season start, I identified ranking sources that had *consistently* produced top-accuracy for Kicker and D/ST over the last 3-5 years-- because I want to test my models against the best benchmarks.  I used the same sources for QB, but it seems I should try and find better sources for comparison.  I would include many more rankings sources if it were feasible, but... it is really tough to maintain all these-- manually!

# 

# D/ST

I had a good long streak of weeks with #1 weekly accuracy, then week 15 had me average relative to other sources.  But in week 16 my model hit #1 again.  My top 7 options were safe, and I didn't have Texans as high as some others.   I could have been higher on Panthers and Wsh, but overall the model worked.

As reminder: The ""predictable range"" metric is proportional to the correlation coefficient.  For reference, my models season average corresponds to a **correlation coefficient of 0.39**.  

[D\/ST accuracy results for the 2020 season](https://preview.redd.it/ersi2xhml4861.jpg?width=792&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9115ee67820fb84548eae40f8d4794c26394eb)

**An alternative look: the ""Accuracy Gap""**.  After week 10, I posted an [in-depth accuracy assessment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/k0v8x2/a_closer_look_at_subvertadown_accuracy_2020/).  I showed the alternative FantasyPros method, which uses their so-called ""accuracy gap"".  In this picture, Koerner is still ahead for the season, as shown here:

[D\/ST season accuracy, measured by the alternative calculation](https://preview.redd.it/2mis92ekm4861.jpg?width=746&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9277303c76af01242afa5c2a4fcabd3e7cac17f5)

# 

# Kicker

I'm really glad to have stayed at the #1 spot in accuracy for *pretty* much all season-- even though my Consensus eventually took the lead, whereas I had set my expectations to FAR surpass other kicker sources.

Week 16 was good for my kicker model.   I really hope it gave most of you good results for your Championships. As you can see below, other sources had their normal struggle at the kicker position.  Only Koerner topped me for the week (mostly by putting Slye lower and Badgley higher).  Most of my top 10 options served well-- excepting Slye who ended up terrible as a #8 pick-- and of course we all know about Succop.  

I find it odd that some people complained about my Succop recommendation.  It wasn't just because he actually had lots of opportunity (to account for lots of misses)... it surprised me because almost every source had Succop in/near its top 5 (Koerner had him at #1)!  So there was something of a consensus about his opportunities, which was not unique to my model. Anyway, yes, ""Fuccop"" definitely gets a spot on my [Kicker Wall of Shame](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/ji0b5s/kickers_2020_wall_of_shame/)....

For reference, my season accuracy corresponds to a **correlation coefficient of** **0.21**:

[Kicker accuracy results for the 2020 season](https://preview.redd.it/8oed7g44p4861.jpg?width=833&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ecead8a79e1709d2e5f671b6aa3a34131e4fab3)

A reminder that I create my handpicked Consensus by *averaging my models with other sources*.  I still expect my own model *alone* should do better (without making a consensus).  I am also very curious how my corrections to weeks 10-13 will look.  I promise I will explain the issue in more detail when I show you!

Then, measured by accuracy gap... my kicker model also definitely held the lead-- doing better than my Consensus, and also doing better with my tiebreaker model that was available on my Patreon.

[Alternative accuracy measurement by week, for selected sources.  A lower gap is better.](https://preview.redd.it/9351k55jp4861.jpg?width=775&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75403b9afc249cc9f589b3372aba96aa40e66d86)

# QB

Also like last week, QB was close to being at its most predictable all season. For all sources.  My model was looking like #1 for the week, until last night's BUF-NE game.  Anyway, still a good week overall: you should have been happy with most of my top 16 QBs, excluding Bridgewater.  

For reference, my accuracy corresponds to a **correlation coefficient of 0.40**:

[QB accuracy results for the 2020 season](https://preview.redd.it/4csz20bxs4861.jpg?width=702&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ca2bb91962868875d2e5f7b5c6042413b9db9c3)

In case you don't recall, **there is a reason I also tracked my accuracy excluding weeks 1-3**: I kind of entered the season with an attitude that I could dare to use only previous season data (but with my own tweaks).  What I ***should*** have done was calibrate my QBs according to public QB ratings (as reported by other sources), to form my ""initial assumptions"".  After I did this (in week 4), my QB model pretty consistently produced top accuracy.  

So here is how weeks 4-16 look for all sources:

[Accuracy over a limited range, due to change in starting input data](https://preview.redd.it/3rdycpijt4861.jpg?width=702&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f63ae4a03564686c3afb73cce58ab3ab29c6eb2)

So I have never before reported the results for this limited span, because it's kind of cheating from what you *actually* got.  But I wanted to show it to you because it gives me reason to be optimistic about implementing the model in the future.  (I just need to incorporate good background assumptions at the season start!)

I do need to improve my game score model, my spread model, and my O/U model-- but despite their deficiencies, I did have some success with a ""betting probability"" model I created, which was intended to try and pick out best bets.  Each week, I placed a bet on several (later even more) higher-probability options.  Normalized to an initial account of ""100"", here is how the season looked (for equal amounts on each bet):

[Relative account balance from betting, versus the chronological number of bet](https://preview.redd.it/j7nacjklv4861.jpg?width=752&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e4d516b18a91bd9c4e8d1228a5511319f6382a)

As you can see, there was reason for optimism in October, which was after I developed the probability model.  However November was dreadful.  Was this due to the error in my Excel sheet?  Or was that span a particularly tough set of weeks for bettors?  Or was it about accounting for mid-season injuries?  I will have to look at this later.  Anyway, overall, the bets came out positive.  I will have to work on this more next year!

Thanks everyone, and I'll be back soon with the other content I mentioned",fantasyfootball,1,1609252158,kmffsg,1
93,Week 16: Top Scoring Lineup - Championship Edition,plastictaxicab,"CONGRATS TO THE CHAMPS!

\---------------------------------

Here is your Week 16 top scoring lineup (standard scoring):

**QB Josh Allen 32.30**

**WR Stefon Diggs 32.50**

**WR Devante Adams 32.20**

**RB Alvin Kamara 53.20**

**RB Myles Gaskin 28.90**

**TE Jimmy Graham 18.90**

**FLEX Mike Evans 30.10**

**DST Carolina 21.00**

This lineup would've given you 249.10 points. A pretty big week for some pretty big name players, and what better time that the finals? Did you survive Kamarageddon? Did your Allen/Diggs stack silence the haters?

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

86,How did you do in all of your leagues?,mosheman100,"I know there is a thread for Champions. But Champions or not, I'm wondering how all you did in your leagues, especially those who play in multiple leagues. Here is how I did ranked from my main league to my least important league. Feel free to share how your seasons went using my format or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Overview: I played in 8 leagues (that is down from the past few years due to being too busy/leagues closing). I made the playoffs in six of the leagues and won two of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Main League (team name- Bal Harbour Rams): 1st Place. This is a Yahoo 12-team keeper league five years running, and I just won back-to-back Championships. I finished the regular season in first place and destroyed in the Championship Game against the regular season second place team. 

&amp;#x200B;

2nd League (team name- For What Whitworth): 4th Place. This is a deep redraft league in its third year. We cut it down to 12 from 14 this year. I'm pretty sure this is my first time making the playoffs in this league (I know I didn't make it last year and I'm pretty sure I didn't make it year 1, but I can't check because we switched to Sleeper year 2 and ESPN is the worst fantasy football platform after NFL and doesn't let you see leagues that are no longer active). It was a $50 buy-in with weekly and season payouts added in on top of the league winner. I finished first in the regular season and netted $15 bucks in this league. 

&amp;#x200B;

3rd League (team name- Bal Harbour Snobs): 4th Place. This is the third year of a deep 10-team dynasty league. It was my first time making the playoffs (only 4 make it). I never played dynasty before this league and I think I figured it out finally. I got some great young talent for the future including Herbert, Hurts, and Justin Jefferson. 

&amp;#x200B;

4th League (team name- FGoff): 1st Place. This is the eighth year of a NFL 12-team redraft league, but I have only been in the league for 3 years. I have made the playoffs every year, but this is the first year I won it. 

&amp;#x200B;

5th League (team name- Los Angeles Rams). 17th Place. This is the 6th year of a 20-team NFL gimmick league. I have only played in three years. The gimmick is that each owner claim 1 NFL team and could only use players from that team. As a Rams fan, I chose the Rams. It really is more of an experiment for fans of teams, but it is enjoyable. The Rams only got me to the playoffs once in this league and that was the first year I played.

&amp;#x200B;

6th League (team name- A Kupple of Clowns). 8th Place. This is a typical Yahoo public league with a Platinum league rating. I unfortunately drafted Michael Thomas, Chubb, and Ekeler, and I lost all of them for a significant portion of the season.  This kept me in last place most of the season, but I was determined not to finish last (the only time I ever finished last was a year when I didn't play fantasy football because my private league fell through right before the season and I didn't remember that I joined a public league on Yahoo). 

&amp;#x200B;

7th League (team name- The Woodsman). 2nd Place. This a typical Yahoo public league with a Gold league rating. I started 0-2 but finished the regular season 10-4. I lost CMC in the league, but still did well. 

&amp;#x200B;

8th League (team name- A Higbee on the Neck). 3rd Place. This is a typical Yahoo public league with a Silver league rating. I finished second in the regular season and dominated this league point wise along with first place with more than 1,700 regular season points each. Still, I was second at 9-5 and the last place team finished the regular season 5-9.",fantasyfootball,1,1609220321,km85aa,1

89,Nfl Playoff Fantasy Playoff Where to Host,Gimme_Karma_please,"Just out of curiosity, not for this season, I heard that some leagues play 16-17 of reg. season fantasy during reg. season nfl and redraft every playoff round to determine a winner.  Is there any free sites that make it easy to track weeklong fantasy matchups or do you have to calculate manually? Sorry if this is obvious; I tried searching but found no answers",fantasyfootball,1,1609219967,km8258,1
90,Who is the player you see when you think ‚Äúfantasy football‚Äù?,Pretty-Sea-6560,Mine is Shaun Alexander. He was TD machine and fantasy football legend. Many leagues were won off of his legs.,fantasyfootball,1,1609219906,km81kd,1

92,Draft Day lineup for the Ship,sir_dickbutt_III,"I was told by all the experts and podcasts that the waiver wire and careful trades won championships. I don't know how it's possible but, I managed to stream my draft day lineup all year and win. There were dark times, a five game losing streak during the heavy bye weeks. I obviously picked up players to fill in QB, TE, DST, and K for those byes but that's all. Our league does an auction style waiver wire so I had to pick up sloppy seconds after the waiver period ended. 
I doubt anyone cares about this but I'm just shocked my team survived all year without Covid IR's or other physical injuries.  Time to get fitted for my Blazer of Champions.",fantasyfootball,1,1609219585,km7ynt,1
93,La‚ÄôMical ‚ÄúThe Iron Horse‚Äù Perine 2021 Expectations,TNRC,"I‚Äôll admit that I was a little skeptical of the Barry Sanders comparisons that this kid was drawing leading up to the draft but damn did he prove me wrong. I‚Äôm not a Jets fan but I ended up watching basically every minute of their games this year just to watch Perine play. Everyone is hung up on his physical gifts, and rightfully so, but what really jumps out at me is his vision. He just knows how to hit holes and is gonna be a big play threat for the next decade. 

With the Jets clearly abandoning the tank for Trevor in the past couple weeks, a lot of people are wondering if maybe they don‚Äôt go QB in the draft, build around Darnold and select Penei Sewell, the elite offensive lineman from Oregon. If that happens Perine‚Äôs ceiling is literally as high as any running back going into next season. 

So what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs expectations of the Iron Horse going into next season? Where do you estimate his ADP to be and how do you think he performs? RB1? High end RB2?",fantasyfootball,1,1609219414,km7x49,1

96,RB1s with Solid Handcuffs Theory,Reddishead,"Random thought just crossed my mind in this RB wasteland year due to injuries. I won both leagues having Kamara in one, Dalvin Cook in the other and Aaron Jones in both. Is there a potential correlation with less injuries on teams that have RB1s with solid back ups that spell them? Seemed to be the case this year.",fantasyfootball,1,1609218410,km7nyx,1
97,Is full PPR Broken?,Lsmrd124,"So hear me out. I play in an 8 man full PPR league and I am pushing for our commissioner to push for a half PPR or standard format for next year. Why? Because, in my opinion, he wide receivers make or break games for people. Since our league only has 8 guys, everyone has these super wide receiver corps on their team. If even one of those guys has a bad game, you‚Äôre going to lose because the wideouts in this day and age can easily put up 35 points a game. 

Case in point. In the championship this weekend, I had Kamara, Tyreek, and Justin Jefferson going against my opponent who had Adams and Diggs. His other wide out? Jarvis Landry who DIDNT EVEN PLAY. He still whipped me because of two 40+ point totals. In standard those only become 32 point efforts. Big difference there. Kamaras performance of the year couldn‚Äôt even hold a candle to the production of those two because the scoring and how the game is played I feel is stacked against running backs. 

Is there any merit to this or do I need to just be quiet?",fantasyfootball,1,1609218306,km7n0d,1

27,Highest Scoring Lineup of the 2020 Season,Burgerboy127,"What a year. This is the highest scoring lineup from the 2020 season in Half PPR format. This is not supposed to represent a possibly drafted team.

**QB: Kyler Murray - 386.96**

**WR: Davante Adams - 287.3**

**WR: Tyreek Hill - 285.4**

**RB: Alvin Kamara - 336.3**

**RB: Dalvin Cook - 315.8**

**TE: Travis Kelce - 260.26**

**W/R/T: Derrick Henry - 288.6**

**K: Jason Sanders - 163**

**DEF: Pittsburgh Steelers - 144**

**BN: Patrick Mahomes - 379.8**

**BN: Calvin Ridley - 229.9**

**BN: DK Metcalf - 226.2**

**BN: James Robinson - 225.9**

**BN: Aaron Jones - 218.9**

**BN: Darren Waller - 202.9**

Again, this is not supposed to represent a possibly drafted team, but wow. James Robinson is probably the biggest surprise on here, who no one knew about going into the draft.

35,Most valuable stack in 2021,periphery3,"After some big championship performances who do believe is the best stack going into next year or who are you targeting and why?
Allen/Diggs
Rodgers/Adams
Mahomes/Kelce or Hill

Think these are probably the top 3, unless I'm overlooking others. I think Allen/Diggs is looking like the top option right now, Diggs is a completely new monster in Buffalo and Allen can get it done with his arm or with his legs. Rodgers is getting up there but a healthy Adams is WR1. Mahomes is a bit trickier because to stack him with another you almost have to use your top 2 picks. Unless this season bumps Allen into top QB talk. Just some thoughts and curious to hear what others think about next season. Congrats to those who won a ship!",fantasyfootball,1,1609215293,km6twz,1

I came close this year, with my king, Josh Allen, however, my opponent had a checkmate with Stefon Diggs.

This year I went RB heavy in an inexperienced auction league, grabbing cook, kamara and Barkley. I know what your thinking, but I also was smart and bought low on some overlooked receiver that weren‚Äôt nominated till late, Keenan Allen, Allen Robinson and kupp. 

After Barkley went down, I lost 5 straight, and was sitting at a miserable 2-5. But then I won, and again and again. I was spending about 3-4 hours a week analyzing the waiver wire, the matchups, streaming players you name it. I used this sub to help me out, and ended up with Gibson and claypool as good pickups. I finished 8-5, riding the hot hand to the playoffs. 

As I got through the playoffs, I realized fantasy was affecting my daily life. My mood would literally depend on my fantasy team. I would get so stressed all Monday cuz it seems all my games boil down to a nail biter on Monday night. This week Kamara set me up in a perfect spot to win. But I had this feeling in my guy it would work out. The rest of my guys underperformed and I could feel it happening. Going into tonight I was up 19 with a kicker against Stefon diggs. That second touchdown was the finsihing blow. Fantasy has been so stressful, just To amount to nothing.

So our rule for the trade deadline was that once you are eliminated from the playoffs, You can no longer trade with other playoff teams. (which will be changed next year due to this incident).

In week 13, The first week of the playoffs, Two managers agreed on a trade of Josh Allen QB, for the Pittsburgh Defense. (shitty trade but there was no collusion so I would have normally approved the trade). One of the managers said that he wanted the trade pushed until week 14. He was eliminated from the playoffs in week 13. So I vetoed the trade because the trade was no longer between 2 playoff teams.

Now that player is saying that he should have (and would have) won the Championship with Josh Allen on his roster. What do you do as commissioner?",fantasyfootball,1,1609210123,km5d18,1

This year however, I finished 6-9 and lost in round 2 of the playoffs. A lot of my issues can be attained to be injuries and bad decision making, but a part of it is putting too much trust in those that played well last year. I picked up devante Parker last year who was excellent‚Äîthis year not so much. I had CMC carry me all last year‚Äîthis year I luckily failed to draft him as he was out 90% of the time. Other such players plagued me, and if I had put more effort into picking the best players and not those that played well when I had them a year prior, I would‚Äôve done much better. I did have Dak Prescott and Zeke, and lost Keenan in the playoffs so I most likely was doomed this season anyways, but going forward I‚Äôll have to plan better. Obviously someone like CMC or Kamara or Mahomes are gonna be top picks every year, but the one late round pick or waiver wire addition that went off for half a season, can‚Äôt be blindly assumed to be at an all star level the following year.",fantasyfootball,1,1609200960,km2mvw,1

What's the play here?  With some teams already being eliminated from the post season, do you still play the studs from those teams?  Do I try and pick up replacements from the waivers?  If the season ended today, I'd be the winner (depending on if Allen/Singletary don't combine for a killer 62 points).

After the Week 14 debacle against the Bills where he dropped several balls and was benched for the entire half, he bounced back with 8 receptions two 30 yd+ touchdowns in both games, basically at 20 PPR for both.

Not to mention that for his ADP, he was an absolute steal, especially in bigger leagues. Was able to grab him at the beginning of the 8th round and he is easily a WR2 with WR1 upside. An overall glance at his season shows that he's had 85 receptions, 828 receiving yards, and about 140 targets along with 7 touchdowns. Not to mention that he missed a game, left two games with injuries early on, and of course the game where he was benched.

To add on, his game is just beautiful to watch, the routes he runs are fantastic and he's overall very shifty. Thanks for the great season, definitely hope I can draft him again next year!",fantasyfootball,1,1609195535,km0xo9,1

So, yeah. Each of my first 5 picks were either hurt for half the year, underperformed, or both. Even DJ in round 6 wasn't amazing (aside from championship week, bless up DJ) and the first pick I really hit on was Waller in round 8. Picking up JRob before week 1 was probably the best preseason decision I could have made. Looking back, most of the players I took had high upside but also very low floors.

So sit down and gather round fantasy friends and let me tell you a tale how this team of cast-aways and forgotten men overcame the odds and won the biggest prize of all. This was my final lineup this championship weekend:
14 Team Superflex
QB: Hurts
RB: Taylor
RB: Jeff Wilson
WR: Kupp
WR: Emmanuel Sanders
TE:  Tonyan
 Flex: David Johnson
Superflex: Tua
D/ST: Browns
K: Koo
Only three players finished top 14 at their position - Taylor, Tonyan and Koo - only one of whom I actually drafted.
My draft this year went as follows: Mixon, Dak, David Johnson, Taylor, Chark, Kupp, Boyd, Hurst, Mattison, Tannehill, Jeudy, Jonnu Smith, Bucs D/ST, Bryan Edwards, Blankenship - 3/15 of those were in my final squad.
So what does any of this mean? Fantasy is 10% draft, 10% strategy and 80% luck and boy did I have a fuckton of luck this year (even with Dak going down, Mixon being Zac Taylor'd). 
[Week 4]( https://i.imgur.com/qovyuIW.jpg): So after having a decent start I was sitting 2-1 in Week 4. Mixon was being Mixon again this season so frustration was growing but Dak was throwing up 40 points a week so things were looking good until I was coming up against Henry, Allen and Ridley (literally top3 at each  position at this point). Preparing to get my ass whooped until Covid threw me a lifeline and Henry out of the game and Mixon decided to produce his single decent performance this year to throw up my best week of the year by far.
[Week 9]( https://i.imgur.com/kRigSRy.jpg): The past few weeks had been bad. I was at 4-4, Dak and Mixon were gone for the season, JT and DJ were busts, my three decent WRs were on BYE and I was up against the most stacked fkn team in the league. All was lost until the DeeJay's starting spinning and threw up 43 pts combined to carry my team over the line, while his decided to shit the bed.
[Week 10]( https://i.imgur.com/T6aWYJX.jpg): After the luckiest performance of the season against the best squad in the league I was about to face the wrath of the Russ, Lockett and DK stack. Seattle had been slinging it all year,  while Robby Anderson proved to be a gem and the Steelers were stealing this guy some big wins. I on the other hand was fucked. JT was benched, DJ was on IR and my highest scoring player would prove to be Tua with a massive 13 pts. My owner's RB corps of CEH and Gurley were on BYE and Hines, having stolen JT's job, broke out with 27pts. But wait..surely my owner couldn't possibly forget to set his lineup, leave CEH and Gurley in, Hines on the bench and lose 68.5-47.5?
[Week 11]( https://i.imgur.com/ojyrfQb.jpg): After back-to-back luckiest wins ever, I fully expected to be brought back to planet earth this week. I was up against Kamara, Evans, Cousins against a dogshit Dallas D and my star RB corps was now Mike Davis, Hyde, Gio and Duke. Brees went down this week and me being a retard decided Jameis slinging it in Sean Payton's  offense was worth the punt on waivers over Tannehill handing the ball to the Tennessee Derrick Henry's. Surely after throwing away the one decent pick I'd made in the draft on a dumb punt I could win this? Surely Hyde and Davis wouldn't throw up 32pts together and win by 2pts? What the actual fuck was happening with this team?

[Playoffs Week 1]( https://i.imgur.com/V4Xrqat.jpg): So we're here. Somehow I've dragged this dogshit team not just to the playoffs but to a 9-4 record and the 2nd seed. But now we're in primetime season, players are tired, beaten up and the weather is shit. Just like every year the King was running for fun, up against the Jags and facing my team of JAGs. Oh and I forgot to mention he had Allen, Ridley, Terry, MJJ, Ekeler and the Saints D against Jalen Hurts in his first career start. I'd heard a rumour on r/ff that Akers was now the guy for the Rams and of course I started him since my other options were, well, limited. You can imagine my surprise when I wake up (in Europe) Friday morning and see that he's put up 30 big ones in the biggest game of the year. But it wasn't long into the early games when Henry started running, and running and running until he put up 50pts and I was destined to lose. And then, like a Phoenix rising from the ashes of overrated rookie RB's and fantasy busts, Jonathan fucking Taylor decides to pop a 44 out of nowhere.

[Playoffs Week 2]( https://i.imgur.com/SD3jTZZ.jpg): Having gotten past the first round, the bad man can't hurt us anymore. Now we just have Tyreek Hill, Jacobs, Swift, Thielen, Andrews and his Herbert&amp;Allen stack to worry about. FUCK. Oh and I forgot to mention he also had the Dolphins D who I'd been streaming on for weeks against the tinpot Patriots offense. However, after Round 1 I knew if I could get some hot waiver pickups in Hurts, Hilton and Jeff Wilson I might have a chance here. Things were looking good, Herbert and Jacobs screwed me in the early game but Allen after screaming ""START ME"" put up a single point. An hour before kickoff I had a big decision to make though. Zeke was out, Pollard was in but do I really start Pollard in his first game as an RB1 when Wilson was against  that Dallas Run Defense? You bet your ass I do and he puts up a 30 burger, while Jalen Hurts studs his way to 31. It all came down to the MNF game, Ben against the Bungles. All he needed was a paltry 12 pts against one of the worst teams in the league. ""Oh well it was nice to get this far with this tea...what? Ben shit the bed?!"". Championship here we come.
[Championship]( https://i.imgur.com/Ohyca9Q.jpg): This is it. One measly game of fantasy fkn football and we've won it all. Somehow the other team had also lucked their way most of the year and his Cook&amp;Kelce stack dragged him to the #1 seed and an easy win when his opponent's team shat the bed in Round 1. Things were looking good until Zeke decided to take my Pollard away and Kittle came off IR. His Cook produced a very sub-par 16 but I was forced to start Jeff Wilson in the Championship. Could he be trusted? Could any of my players really be trusted (aside from JT, Kupp and Hurts)? You bet your ass they couldn't but this is fantasy remember, it's literally pot fucking luck so when Jeff decided to pop a 36 against the crappy Cardinals I knew barring a Kelce explosion I had a good shot of winning. Sunday rolls around and despite subpar performances from the Browns, Koo (bless him) and my WR's, the corpse of David Johnson went on one last rodeo for 33 against the Bungles. That was it, my team of corpses and throwaways had done it and claimed the biggest prize of all.

So what's the lesson in all of this? Fantasy is literally 10% setting a damn lineup (Pro Tip: Don't start players on BYE weeks), 10% strategy (this sub offered some amazing bits of insight amongst a trove of other horseshit) and 80% luck. Don't take it too seriously. This is the first year I took it easy and honestly, I expected my team to lose each week so it made it sweeter when they didn't. It's just a damn game and if this post says anything it's that no matter how shit your players are over a season, you just need them one damn weekend from the next.",fantasyfootball,1,1609188772,klyr5m,1

37,Thank You Aaron Rodgers üßÄ,Justin_Herbert10,"Aaron Rodgers came into the season highly undervalued for fantasy. He had Davante Adams and that's it. Packers didn't give him any help during the off-season and everyone's consensus was that Aaron wasn't going to be the Aaron of old for fantasy purposes this year and he was dropping in some mocks (and leagues) to overall pick 100 and above, QB12 and above.

Aaron Rodgers shut all his doubters up this year. Not only is he in the running for NFL MVP but he may have been the best value pick in fantasy.

Yes you have your Justin Jefferson, James Robinson, and your Will Fuller. But Aaron surpasses them all.

In 15 games, with the exception of a 5.80 game vs TB, he put up a MINIMUM of 18.20 every game.

He is the QB3 of the year, averaging over 24 PPG.

No one saw this coming as he utilized everyone he could from Lazard to MVS to Tonyan to obviously Adams.

78,A huge thank you to Justin Herbert,Justin_Herbert10,"Unless you went early for Mahomes/Lamar, or waited for 4-9 Rounds and went Dak, Brady, Allen, Watson, you most likely drafted a QB late in your drafts with one of your final picks (Big Ben, Goff, Baker, Rivers etc)

And due to injury (Dak) or just bad play (Ryan) you had to pivot. Along came a Rookie that has taken the NFL by storm: Justin Herbert.

Herbert did not the start the season and only got a chance because a team doctor punctured Tyrod Taylor's lung.

But what Herbert has done has been nothing short of legendary and historic.

With the exception of Week 3 vs CAR (who has kept QBs in check for most of the year) and his week 6 Bye week, from Week 2-11 he scored at least 21 points in every game, giving us 3 games over 27 and almost a 40 point game!

Yes Week 12-14 he may have hit a rookie slump, only scoring 40.52 points, but Week 15 he came through with almost 28 points and led most who stuck with him to the promise land!

In a world where most QBs outside of the Top 10 are streamed, or we play the matchups, rarely does a QB come along that reaches set and forget territory. 

But that is where Herbert entered. For almost 2 months straight he was one of the best QBs in fantasy, hell the NFL -- not just rookie QBs.

Through Week 16 he is 6th in the NFL in Pass yards and 10th in Pass TDs

Yes some say when Ekeler came back, he hurt him more than helped, and that may be true in the sense of him rushing, but he has his weapons in Ekeler, Keenan, Hunter, along with Guyton and Johnson.

His future is bright in the NFL and for fantasy purposes.

I am in the championship playing a team that had the 8th most points, but always played teams that had an off week. If I played him every week I would've been 15-0 including the playoffs.


Robinson was out. Golliday has been out all season. I had to decide two players to play. Gibson (RB-Was), Aiyuk (WR-SF), Lamb (Dal-WR), or Cooks (Hou-WR).


I decided to go with Aiyuk and Gibson since Lamb and Cooks are boom or bust. At the last second I put Lamb in. When I did that my 6 month old started crying as loud as possible for no reason at all. We were rocking in a chair and he was playing with his favorite toy. I took that as a sign and removed Lamb and put Gibson back in.


Because of my awful decisions I need Allen to get me 32 points tonight. He is someone who can pull it off. Josh is the only one I want in this situation.",fantasyfootball,1,1609172907,kltkr6,1

57,Live auction draft advice for 2021 please,firesatnight,"After every fantasy season, our league puts out a survey and we vote on changes for the next year. We always do a live, in-person draft, and in 2020 we decided to try auction style. As commissioner, and as the person who really pushed switching to auction, I did my damndest to make it a smooth transition, but it was still a shit show. I bought a giant dry-erase board for keeping track of remaining money and # of drafts. I bought auction paddles. We had clicky draft ready on a television but realized it wasn't compatible with auction drafts way too late and had to keep track of drafted players manually.

First, it took forever as we kept trying to figure out the tempo of the draft. Second, one guy ended up having to keep track everything on the white board as the ""math"" was too complicated for some of the... less intelligent of the group. This wasn't really fair to him as he couldn't concentrate as much on his team. Third, there was a lot of shouting and confusion in general.

In the end, we all still had fun, and I think everyone agreed it is the superior draft method. But it's going to come to a vote again and if I can't find a way to assure the group it won't be absolute chaos, they are going to vote to revert back to snake draft. Which I think would be a shame.

I know it's a little early to start talking draft for next year.... but does anyone have any tips on how to make a live auction draft less like torture? I was thinking I would maybe make a spread sheet where you put in how much money you spent and it auto-calculated everything? We are not opposed to spending money on the needed tools to make it a success.

Thank you!!",fantasyfootball,1,1609169173,klsgd5,1

5 weeks of winning later i found myself in the playoffs. 2 weeks later I had defeated the #1 and #2 seeds by 15 and 20 points respectively. JT Szn saved me down the stretch after Gurley dropped off the face of The earth but he lasted long enough for me to stay in it until Chubb came back.

63,Adjusting for W17 Championship Games - 2020,Another_Name_Today,"While most of the sub is either celebrating or drowning their tears, there are a few of us who have one more week to go.  Either we have two week championships during W16/17 or we just have our finals in W17.  A lot of folks think it's terrible, and it has its benefits and drawbacks, but we aren't changing the rules mid-season and that discussion is better left to the offseason or one of the League Issues threads.

For W17, keep in mind the following playoff implications:

* KC Chiefs (Mahommes, Hill, Kelce) - 1 seed clinched, nothing to lose or gain.  Play the Chargers.
* Buffalo Bills (Allen, Diggs, Singletary) - competing for the 2 seed, path is a little harder if they lose to the Pats tonight.  Play the Dolphins.
* Pittsburgh Steelers (Roethlisberger, bunch of WRs, RB?) - competing for the 2 seed. Play the Browns, at the same time as the Bills/Dolphins game.
* Tennessee Titans (Tannehill, Brown, Henry) - competing for the division or WC. Play the Texans in a late game - by game start, they will know if they have clinched a playoff spot.
* Indianapolis Colts (Rivers, Taylor, Hilton) - long shot competing for the division or WC. Play the Jags in a late game, at the same time as the Titans/Texans game - by the time game starts, they will know if they have been eliminated from WC contention and can only compete for the division.
* Miami Dolphins (Fitzpatrick, whoever is healthy) - competing for the WC. Play the Bills.
* Baltimore Ravens (Jackson, Brown, Dobbins/Edwards) - competing for the WC. Play the Bengals at the same time as the Dolphins/Bills.
* Cleveland Browns (Mayfield, Landry, Chubb) - competing for the WC. Play the Steelers, at the same time as the Ravens/Bengals and Dolphins/Bills.
* GB Packers (Rodgers, Adams, Jones) - clinch the 1 seed with a win. Play the Bears in a late game.
* NO Saints (Brees, Sanders, Kamara) - in position for the 1 seed. Play the Panthers in a late game.
* Seattle Seahawks (Wilson, Metcalf, Carson)  - in position for the 1 seed. Play the 49ers in a late game at the same time as the Saints/Panthers game.
* Washington (Smith, McLaurin, Gibson) - clinch the division with a win.  Play the Eagles in the SNF game.
* Dallas Cowboys (Dalton, Cooper, Elliot) - competing for the division. Play the Giants.
* NY Giants (Jones, Slayton, Engram) - competing for the division. Play the Cowboys.
* TB Buccaneers (Brady, Evans, Fournette) - competing to play the NFC East champ in the first round. Play the Falcons.
* LA Rams (Goff, Kupp, Woods) - competing for the WC. Play the Cards in a late game.
* Arizona Cardinals (Murray, Hopkins, Drake) - competing for the WC. Play the Rams in a late game.
* Chicago Bears (Trubisky, Robinson, Montgomery) - competing for the WC. Play the Packers in a late game at the same time as the Rams/Cards game.

When I started writing this, I thought I was going to start compiling a list of studs you could plan to bench.  However, the only team that can, with total confidence, rest its starters are the Chiefs.  Everybody else in the playoffs or in contention has something to play for, whether it is a spot or seeding.

I know this post is mostly meaningless, but the point is that just about every game has meaning for the playoffs.  I've been getting alerts like JuJu won't play next week because the Steelers have clinched the AFCN and ignoring the seeding battles. I read posts that say that W17 fantasy games are terrible because none of your studs are playing.  This year, unless you have a Chief, I don't see a lot of obvious sits.  I'll be shedding tears as I probably bench Kelce.  

Note: Even among the less meaningful games, Raiders/Broncos is always a fun time, Herbert's and Cook's seasons have been fun to watch, and I suspect the Jets would call 3-13 a strong finish if they can beat Bill.",fantasyfootball,1,1609168511,kls9ml,1

I‚Äôm absolutely livid at Drew Lock for ruining a bigger day for Melvin Gordon. Gordon was running well all day (5 yards per carry) but only got 16 carries and 0 targets. Lock didn‚Äôt help by throwing turnovers and falling behind and abandoning the run too soon even though Gordon was probably their best threat. He refused to look his way when passing even though he was often uncovered for an easy 5 yards. And to cap it all off towards the end of the game a Broncos receiver gets tackled at the 1 with Gordon in the game, and I already start to get excited for the Gordon quick snap easy rush in TD, and instead bleeping Drew Lock sneaks it in for the touchdown.

Screw you Drew Lock!! (Fantasy hate only)",fantasyfootball,1,1609154555,klos5c,1

65,Davante Adams is a MAN amongst boys. Is this one of the greatest fantasy WR seasons ever? Here‚Äôs some mind blowing stats from his 2020 season.,OnceABullfrog,"Seriously. 

And yet somehow entering this season, he still wasn‚Äôt routinely mentioned in discussions about the Top 5 WRs in the league. That was a joke before the year began and it most definitely is now.

I don‚Äôt think anyone can question it anymore. He‚Äôs a Top 3 WR and arguably, straight up THE best.

Just take a look at some of his numbers from this season.

He missed 2 full games earlier in the year and yet will still very likely finish with the 2nd most fantasy points among all WRs.

His current numbers so far through 13 games? 
109 receptions, 1328 yards, 17 TD‚Äî-This comes out to an average of 26.4 PPR points/game.

If you project these numbers over a full 16 game season....134 receptions, 1634 yards, 20 TD 

Take a look at some of the huge games he‚Äôs had in this year alone....

14-156-2
13-196-2
7-53-3
10-173-1
10-121-2
11-142-3

Just for shits and giggles, I extrapolated those 6 games out to a full 16 game season and came up with these absolutely ridiculous numbers that would even be too unrealistic for video games....

173 receptions, 2243 yards, 34 TD 

601.3 PPR points 
37.6 points / game

At this point, would anyone really be THAT surprised to see him post numbers close to this? I wouldn‚Äôt.

59,A thank you to everyone here,raynerayne7777,"I know this type of post has been made a few times as people‚Äôs fantasy seasons ended, but I feel compelled to add

As the title says, I wanted to say thank you to all of you who contribute to this great sub. Especially in a chaotic year like this one, being a able to read and discuss fantasy topics with y‚Äôall made the year so much more enjoyable. I‚Äôve always been decent at fantasy and consistently make the playoffs, but from the crowdsourced news and discussions on this sub, I made some great moves (from all your advice) that contributed to my strongest team ever. 

We ultimately came up short in the championship, but sometimes in fantasy you face Alvin Kamara and then Davante Adams rips your last bit of hope from you 5 minutes into the Sunday night game. Regardless, I can‚Äôt help but feel grateful for finding this page and having people to talk fantasy with. 

So again, shoutout to all of you who contribute to this sub. Even through the frustration of losing (both from pride and money lost), I wanted to be sure to recognize everyone who made the fantasy season so much more enjoyable than in years past.

I was winning convincingly until late afternoon today and to my shock, I see that he was able to shuffle his players who had already played yesterday. He had played Kyler Murray, LeVeon Bell, Houston Defense and Mike Nugent as K. He was able to change it to Kirk Cousins, Antonio Brown, Tampa Bay Defense and Will Lutz from his squad after the match. What's funny is he was still losing after this and he was able to make more changes - he added Samaje Perine from the waivers now and I have screenshot proof of that. There is no way this should happen in an ESPN league. I have contacted support but still waiting to hear from them. Any help is appreciated.",fantasyfootball,1,1609120069,klgjku,1

68,Is the end of the fantasy season bittersweet to anyone else?,jumboshrimp93,"When summers come to an end, it‚Äôs about time to start another fantasy season. Sometimes, before the season starts, I wonder if it‚Äôs even worth playing again (it takes up quite a bit of my time and mental space and can be stressful at times), but I remember how fun it can be. Winning it all certainly is a great feeling (2nd time in a row, thanks in large part to this sub!!!) 

So I end up playing. Leading up to draft starts to get more exciting. Then it‚Äôs 16 weeks of grinding, research, watching games, winning and losing, joy and regret, getting excited over breakouts, you might become a new fan of a certain player (I‚Äôm a Kamara fan now for sure!)

After all that, you either make it to the playoffs or don‚Äôt. Then if you‚Äôre in the playoffs you either get knocked out or win it all. I know many feel relief that it‚Äôs all over, and I sure feel some of that, but it‚Äôs also a little sad. I notice how much time I spent on here and how much focus is put on the season, and when it‚Äôs all over, it feels like something is missing. I look forward to playoff football, but not as much this year since my Pats didn‚Äôt make it lol.

With my season wrapping up tonight with no Monday players, it feels a little bittersweet. Happy that I won, of course, but a little sad that it‚Äôs over and now I gotta find something else to occupy my time! Anyone else feel this same way?

Congrats to those taking home a ship, better luck next year to those who didn‚Äôt make it. Happy new year and enjoy postseason football!",fantasyfootball,1,1609119891,klghut,1

75,"Fellow fantasy rookies, what have you learned from this fantasy season and what will you do differently in 2021?",sofargone_7,"Let me start off by showing appreciation to this sub for making it a lot easier to learn and get into fantasy football!

Now, for me personally, I'm staying away from the ""start your studs at all times"" nonsense that cost me or nearly cost me quite some games even when I didn't like their matchup beforehand (Russ, Zeke and even Nuk at times).

Also, I'll actually research what teams run a RBBC before the draft starts - Colts, Niners, Rams - or what teams are way too pass-heavy to have a totally reliable fantasy relevant RB - Steelers, Chiefs. Not that CEH was that bad, but I drafted him waaaay too high ahead of guys like Henry, due to him being inexistent in the pass game (full PPR), or even Dalvin Cook due to his consistent injuries in the past.

Finally: draft a stud TE like Kelce, Waller or Kittle early. The TE landscape was a total wasteland this season. Has it always been that way? I considered myself happy when my TE offered my 9 pts lol. I think I remember reading somewhere that Travis Kelce was among the most rostered players on championship teams this season, so I'll definitely look into drafting one of those 3 TE's early next season. 

&amp;#x200B;

So fellow fantasy rookies, what are your biggest takes on the season?

32,"Because of his poor performance and ruining Edwards-Helaire, I call Le'Veon Bell the worst non-injury affected draft pick this season",IAmADopelyLitSavage,"Going into the draft Bell was not thought of highly, but he was in a 3-4 tier of RBs along with guys like Gurley, Conner, David Johnson. Yes he missed Weeks 2-4, but those were meaningless because of how bad he was anyway. His biggest game was 13/60 Week 5, last game on the Jets. He went to Kansas City where he did absolutely nothing. Owners had two decent opportunities to start him: Lead back Week 13, put up 11/40 and 2/15. Lead back in the title game, puts up 7/30 and 1/9. 

Not only was he terrible on his own, and screwed his owners in the few games they could ""confidently"" start him, but he proceeded to completely destroy Helaire's upside, ruining the preseason fantasy prospects of a prospective top 5-10 RB and basically rendered him a low RB2, if that.

After Murray's and Hopkins performances for me yesterday and Gaskins performance for him, and that he still has Patrick mahomes and Aaron Jones while I am missing CMC, it kinda feels like the writing is on the wall. 

I ask for big performances from the rest of the players that got me here: for Chris Carson to put up big numbers against the Rams defense that lost to the Jets, for the Austin eckler stash so that he scores like he should have been scoring all season, for Giovanni Bernard to shine in the desolate wasteland that is the Cincinnati offense, for Allen Robinson putting up big numbers when I needed itand need again, for Corey Davis to continue his tear against middling defenses and who helped me knock out the Kamara owner in the first round, and for Tyler Bass to kick them long and hard and through the uprights. Praise be to Waller and the buccaneers defense who did their job appropriately and exceptionally.  Although I picked up some of you from the free agent waiver wires I stashed you just for this week knowing you had good matchups and big game potential.

87,The WORST Championship Loss In Fantasy Football History - Good Luck Today!,TheWhiteTestament,"Kamara, Gaskin or Wilson massive scores got you down?  I'm here to remind you all that nothing is guaranteed when it comes to Fantasy Football.  To provide concrete evidence of this, I present to you the recap of my first and only championship appearance in fantasy football.

In 2017, I made it to my first ever championship game. I had dominated the first two games in the fantasy playoffs. I was playing my biggest arch-rival in my money league and lots of money was on the line. Todd Gurley goes off and scores 44.60 for me, all but securing my first ever win. My opponents team did admirable, including a 31.03 point performance from Dion Lewis. All his players finished. The score was his 123.83 to my 123.74. I was down by 0.09 points. However, I had two players left. They were projected for a combined total of 17 points. Jesse James and Michael Crabtree. My opponent started giving his ""GG"" posts and I was talking the most trash I had ever done. I had finally done it.

To make matters even better for me, the two players played on Christmas Eve. I was about to get a HUGE bonus for Christmas after coming in 1st place overall.

I remember, quite vividly, watching the Jesse James game. He caught a touchdown, giving me the win. I was at my grandma's house watching the game and I jumped around screaming. He caught it, a spectacular catch. Under review. They ruled him down, even though the announcers all agreed he had scored. That would be Jesse James only target for the entire night. A reversed touchdown. 0 points from Mr. James.

That's all right, Michael Crabtree played next. He wasn't the best all year, but had multiple 20+ point games thus far. In every game he played that season, he had at least 1 catch. Heck, that's all I needed -- not even 1 yard. This was a 0.5 PPR league. One catch for 0 yardage would secure me the win.

I watched the game, expecting a win right off the bat. He gets a target, but it was a bad throw. No more targets the 1st quarter. 2nd quarter comes around... he gets another target. Another bad throw. Minutes go bye. One more target, he drops it. Then it was halftime.

Third quarter starts up, a new receiver is in. Crabtree is missing. Third quarter ends. Fourth quarter starts up, no Crabtree. I frantically check here on Reddit, no news of an injury. I check news on Twitter. Nothing. Crabtree remains out the rest of the game. To this day, I still have no knowledge as to why he was pulled the 2nd half. He scores 0 points.

And I lose. By 0.09 points. Not even 0.5, which again, a single CATCH for 0 YARDS would have given me the win, but by 0.09.

I will never forget the day when two of my players goose-egged me on Christmas Eve to lose me the championship. I wept.

So if you're down big by Kamara's performance, you've still got a chance.  My 40+ Todd Gurley performance didn't secure me the win, as I had anticipated.  Can anyone top losing a championship game for big money by less than 0.1 points?

It‚Äôs not clear which one will be getting more volume, or if it will be some sort of 50/50 split. Ogunbowale got more action last week, which makes him seem like the more clear play. On the flip side, Ozigbo (according to some) could be in line for the early down work (https://twitter.com/lateroundqb/status/1341014599802470402?s=21) and Sean Koerner has Ozigbo higher than Ogunbowale (https://twitter.com/the_oddsmaker/status/1343211552514568192?s=21) at RB36 vs RB46.

11,Mecole Hardman splash plays incoming?,JockBlocked,"Atlanta represents the worst pass defense in the league. Mecole was drafted high by Kansas City and has world class speed. Last game he had a beautiful toe drag catch but he also was targeted on a long ball (where he was absolutely lit up) against a good Saints defense. I think Tyreek and Kelce will both get TDs but I also fully expect Hardman to receive some deep targets and get loose on at least one. This is a great spot and he‚Äôs likely available to pick up and play. I‚Äôve got him in the lineup as my third wideout over CDLamb and TYHilton in a heavy weight title fight. I think Kansas City is going to pile on stats today as records are in play and an MVP is on the line for Mahomes. For those that don‚Äôt think teams pay attention to this stuff, consider the advertising dollars that get spent every year and realize that stats drive ratings in the Fantasy Football age. These teams absolutely love to see their studs eat and Mecole can help Mahomes make a major statement today and put some TDs and yards on his resume. The final piece of the argument is that Mecole is the future over Sammy or Robinson. They made a point to get this guy and he has momentum after his catch last week. They want to get this guy rolling and confident as they look to a larger role next season.",fantasyfootball,1,1609084667,kl5wwi,1

26,UPDATED: NFL Week 16 Match-Up Tool For Every Game And Relevant Stats,DailyRotoHelp,"If you're still alive in your season-long, congrats! If you're not but play DFS this can help as well!

What's in the Box?!

QB, RB, WR, TE, Red Zone Passes, Red Zone Rushes, and Red Zone Receptions. In each category, we have how many Fantasy Points Per Game the defense has given up, who their opponent is, and how many fantasy points per game the team has accrued so far in 2020. Along with that, we have every stat you need to find the perfect match-ups this weekend. Whether you're playing season-long or DFS, this matchup tool has the most stats that will help out. Will update the PIT/BAL players once the game is played and stats are up to date!

**Again, this chart isn't optimized for mobile so it's best to open it up on a desktop with the many stats and columns the tables have. Just a heads up. **

If I happened to miss some players please let me know and I'll get them added.

***With the Browns WRs out, and other players being ruled out, we have tried to update this as much as possible. I could have missed some players so let me know!***

A good example is Gallman like 5 or 6 weeks ago. He was not having exactly the best fantasy games but anyone watching him could see a tremendous burst and ability to play. The experts did not start ranking him higher until his pt total went up, 0 to do with his actual talent as a player.",fantasyfootball,1,1609063284,kl180i,1
94,"First time commissioner, question about keeper league and 2021 draft",dw-nfl,"Our league voted to allow managers to keep one player at the round drafted. Most managers will keep their top player in round one, a few might keep a late round flyer who came good.

My question is about whether or not I'm running this correctly. I'm odds on to win the league and keep Kamara, drafting at #10 (10 team league, snake draft). I'd then get pick #11 and would be off to a very strong start in the draft. Conversely, the team who drafts at #1 and has a poor team will have to keep a fairly poor player, and still have fairly bad options for pick #1. Feels like the draft is going to favour me quite heavily, when I should be getting the least advantage ideally. 

Is this right? Or should there be some kind of pre-first keeper round?

Advice appreciated.",fantasyfootball,1,1609061771,kl0y5u,1
95,Best Possible Fantasy Lineup All Time,lavasharkandboygirl,"Alright this could probably be cross posted in r/theydidthemath, but my question is what is the highest scoring possible fantasy week a person could have ever had? Essentially, if we went back in history, and summed up the highest scorer in each position of a given week for every week, which combination would have scored to be most points all time?

For example, we‚Äôve got a lot of games to go this week still, but if someone had Brady, Kamara, Evans, and Gaskin, they‚Äôd have an insanely high total. But what is the highest total a person could‚Äôve possibly had for a given week?",fantasyfootball,1,1609061555,kl0wtm,1
96,Why we should be cautious about Lamar Jackson tomorrow,paradise2844,"The giants allow the 6th least FPTS against the QB, something us Lamar owners are probably aware of: BUT...

1. They haven‚Äôt allowed over 2 passing touchdowns in a game since week one. 

2. They‚Äôve only allowed ONE rushing touchdown from a QB all season. One! On a one yard plunge by Carson Wentz. 

3. They held Russel Wilson and Kyler Murray to a combined 92 yards on 20 rush attempts on the ground. Both threw for 1 touchdown each. 

4. A QB has only scored more than 25 fantasy points against them twice this season. 

I would like to just say I HAVE NO IDEA IF ANY OF THIS IS WORTH LOOKING INTO. This could mean nothing and Lamar continues his hot streak tomorrow with 30+ points. I could be completely wrong.

70,Fantasy Football Modified League,junkyarddoggy,"Has anybody played in a modified fantasy football league where the concept of weekly matchups is eliminated?

Here is what I mean: Have you ever had a great week, scoring 170 points, only to lose because you were playing the one other team in the league that outperformed you? You would‚Äôve won if you had been playing any other team in the league, but you got unlucky because of the arbitrary team the fantasy app matched you up against for that week. Or vice versa, you managed to win a week that you didn‚Äôt deserve to by scoring 90 points because you were lucky enough to go up against the only team to manage a lower score than you for that week.

In an effort to reward the best teams rather than the luckiest, I believe it would make more sense to modify the format of the league where instead of having weekly matchups against a single opponent, you are competing against the entire league. A win would be awarded to the top 5 scoring teams (in a 10 man league, 6 for a 12 man league, etc.) each week. This eliminates the scenario I described above and makes the playing field level by effectively giving every team the same PA. This rewards the teams who perform better than the rest of the league on a weekly basis rather than the teams who get the luckiest matchups.

Just curious if anyone has ever done something like this. Some people enjoy the factor of luck in fantasy football, which I can understand, but I for one am sick of seeing a playoff spot awarded to teams with a lower PA over a team with a higher PF. PF can be controlled to a certain extent and is a better measurement of fantasy knowledge, while PA is completely out of your control. 

Sorry if something like this is discussed often here, I am not a frequent on this subreddit.

Would love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts.",fantasyfootball,1,1609041208,kkwmau,1

For reference, Kamara owner in our league is in the finals, but also started Murray, Hopkins, Stafford, and MJJ. Their odds of winning went from 88% to 48%!

3,The reason to start Kittle,raynerayne7777,"Excluding Kelce and Waller, Kittle should start at TE, and here‚Äôs why:

Even on a snap count, this is not a hamstring on a short week. Kittle has been out for 2 months, so he‚Äôs far healthier than a hobbled player who hasn‚Äôt been on IR. The snap count has been tied directly to Kittle‚Äôs fitness, which he admits is slightly lacking. I imagine he takes fewer snaps than a full load, but still much more than the Jordan Reed example from earlier this year. Also, for what it‚Äôs worth, the fantasy doctor seems adamant that the reinjury risk is very low.

Next, take into account this is a divisional rivalry game where the eliminated 49ers can spoil the Cardinals season. 

Kittle was activated to contribute to this, and even though he‚Äôs playing with the third string Qb, CJ Beatheard was also his college QB. He‚Äôs gotten 7+ targets in all pro games they‚Äôve played together. He is going to get peppered with targets when he‚Äôs in.

Taking all this into account, my feeling is that he‚Äôs much stronger play than the uncertainty around him now is leading everyone to believe. Kittle is a beast, which is why he was taken so early in drafts, and so a healthy Kittle is primed to be effective.

Those are my thoughts. Take them as you will",fantasyfootball,1,1609005045,kkmkft,1

His week 16 performance this year out scored his week 16 performance last year where he was given the starting role but only came up with 4.3 PPR points. Are we going to have a repeat this year, if so, who is it?",fantasyfootball,1,1609004816,kkmi5t,1
8,Ride the Blankenship to the Championship this Week,Science4every1,"Yes, yes, I know our lord and savior subvertadown is not high on him this week. 

But who cares?

1. The steelers defense has been decimated in recent weeks. We all saw what happened against a Ryan Finley led Bengals last week. This steelers defense is not the same that got them to 11-0. The matchup is a lot better than it looks

2. Blankenship has been a rock. He's the #4 kicker overall and has only missed 3 FGs all season. If you don't have Koo or Sanders, you should be starting this guy. 

3. All his best games have come against playoff caliber teams. He also does not seem to be very influenced by home vs away games, he is just as comfortable kicking outdoors as indoors

4. The weather in Pittsburgh is just fine. Wind will only be 5-7 mph 

5. Colts offense has been performing extremely well. Despite the steelers' ""vaunted"" defense, the over under is 44.5 and the colts are favored by -1.5. This means plenty of scoring opportunities for Blankenship. He does best in these competitive games. 

6. His name is fucking Blankenship and he wears glasses. I don't think you need any other reason to have him in your starting lineup

16,Concern for Tyreek Hill,Danielrdn1,Is anyone legitimately concerned about Tyreek Hill‚Äôs prospects for playing this week or having a large role? It seems like experts aren‚Äôt worried at all but it‚Äôs an easy matchup and hamstring injuries seem to be the bane of wide receivers if they don‚Äôt heal right.

22,Why are the experts so high on Jeff Wilson Jr. in PPR formats?,scottieburr,"I've been tinkering with my lineup this week and noticed that Fantasypros ECR has Jeff Wilson Jr. at RB12 this week in PPR formats but at the same time he has an RB25 rank in standard. This would be expected from a receiving back, but Wilson is not (9 catches in 10 games). Additionally, Arizona gives a small target-share to RBs. By all accounts this discrepancy doesn't make sense and I'm inclined to trust the standard ranking of RB25 more, which would have me starting Dobbins and MG3 over him. Any Wilson owners have clarity on this?",fantasyfootball,1,1609003157,kkm1qo,1
23,ESPN site and App down. Need to make changes before 1 eastern!,Streetvan1980,I need to change out James Robinson for Fournett before 1pm eastern!

Whatever has happened all year, past performance is not always a predictor of future success! Show us your balls!!!",fantasyfootball,1,1609002507,kklv8f,1
27,Eagles getting a lot of hype this week. Feelings about rolling out both Hurts AND Sanders?,39andaHalfFootPole,"After his Week 15 performance, Hurts (401/4) vaults into the top 5 of QB rankings.

Sanders had a great Week 14 performance (136/2), but seemed to get overshadowed on playmaking decisions in Week 15 (90/0) where Hurts just ran it himself. Experts are ranking Sanders within the top 10 RBs this week because the Cowboys D is so bad.

Both players are getting a lot of love this week but I've never been a fan of a QB/RB stack on the same fantasy team unless the RB is a big time pass catcher, which Sanders is not. Can Hurts and Sanders realistically both eat this week because the Cowboys D is so bad?

For those rolling out both players, what are your thoughts/feelings?",fantasyfootball,1,1609002473,kkluvi,1

53,"*Differentiating between Gaskin, McKissic, and Wilson Jr:*",alldayidreamaboutF,"Looking like lots of managers questioning Gaskin or McKissic/ Gibson or Wilson Jr so I thought I‚Äôd share my logic and invite y‚Äôall to discuss:

*Differentiating between Gaskin, McKissic, and Wilson Jr:*

I played Dalvin as RB1 yesterday and saw firsthand how his fantasy day was negatively affected by negative gamescript as he sat in the 4th. 

Along the same lines, I worry that Wilson Jr and the 49ers (eliminated from the playoffs) and 5.5 point underdogs for Saturday‚Äôs game might be in a similar position and Wilson Jr could be affected similarly to the way in which Dalvin Cook was yesterday. Also, it seems likely 49ers will have him in a timeshare with McKinnon and Coleman. On the season, Wilson Jr has 25 of 78 red zone looks, McKinnon has 22 of 78, and Coleman has 3 of 78. Mostert has 11 of 78, but he‚Äôs not playing this week.

On the other hand, Gaskin and the Dolphins improve their chances of a playoff birth to ~67% with a win in a game they are favored to win, which means there‚Äôs a better chance of positive gamescript late into 4th, positively affecting Gaskin‚Äôs statline. Yes there‚Äôs a chance Ahmed shares time with Gaskin, particularly after such a good performance against New England last week, but let us not forget that Gaskin has been the Dolphins workhorse this year and given that they *need* to win this game, they will likely do what they can to get their workhorse Gaskin opportunities. Gaskin has 37/84 red zone looks despite his absence and Howard having 10/84 (he‚Äôs not longer on the team). Ahmed has only 19. Also in week 13, Gaskin‚Äôs last game played he had 7, and no other Dolphins RB had any. One last note is on Gaskin is that Raiders defense looked horrible last week against LAC and they have nothing to play for this week; looks like the softest matchup of the bunch.

It‚Äôs complicated because McKissic and Washington are in a similar position to Gaskin and the Dolphins in that they need a win for a playoff birth. This situation is different however in that Gibson has been the lead back for Washington all season long, and if he can go, he becomes the Gaskin to the Dolphins Ahmed imo. If he can‚Äôt go, McKissic should benefit, which is why I‚Äôm going to monitor for an update prior to Dolphins kickoff. In terms of red zone looks, Gibson leads Washington with 30/69, followed by McKissic who has 23/69, Barber is third with 16/69. It looks a much more even share relative to the Dolphins situation above.

What do y‚Äôall think? 

I‚Äôm also open to playing two of these 3 RBs potentially, if for example Gibson is ruled out then playing Gaskin as RB2 and McKissic at flex. Independent of Gibson playing I‚Äôm leaning towards Diontae Johnson at flex however based on his target volume alone and especially considering his bounce back game last week, which suggests he‚Äôs unlikely to be benched and now looking like Roethlisberger‚Äôs clear best target in a game the Steelers need to win. I also have DJ Moore on bench, but don‚Äôt think he is as *likely* to perform at Diontae‚Äôs level considering Panthers are eliminated.",fantasyfootball,1,1609000089,kkl6s1,1

Been doing these featured rankings for a few weeks, and they‚Äôve typically been individual based.  A few days ago, I got this idea to see how certain groups did at ranking (not just individual users).  So I‚Äôm putting up $100 for this [Reddit vs Radio Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kixypb/fantasy_rankings_reddit_vs_radio_team_reddit/).  

Got 2 members that do Sports Radio to compete against 2 members who browse r/fantasyfootball, to see who has more accurate rankings this week (as a group, not just the individual).  Got a few volunteers to represent Team Reddit, but since it‚Äôs only fair to pit 2 against 2, Team Reddit for this week is u/PeakedInHighSkool and u/clunas7

84,"Fellow A.J. Brown owners, are we trusting him to win us our ring?",sofargone_7,"First of all: a belated merry Christmas, I hope you guys weren't facing Kamara and are still in this thing!

Now, I know most of us have read [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kj7onn/jacob_gibbs_on_twitter_jaire_alexander_hasnt_been/) suggesting Jaire Alexander will probably cover the RWR, which will most likely be Corey Davis. However, the Packers haven't really played a LWR worth shadowing since week 10, besides maybe DJ Moore, so I personally am a bit skeptical about that statement. 

Allen Robinson - who plays most of his snaps on the right anyways, so he wasn't necessarily shadowed - did have a great fantasy day in week 12, but Jaire was coming off an injury and was limited in practice that week. Now, Jaire should be fully healthy this week and I cannot imagine him staying away from the Titans' best receiver in AJ Brown in a must-win game in efforts to secure the bye week in the NFC.

91,NFL Week 16 WR/CB Match-Up Chart,DailyRotoHelp,"This was helpful for a lot of people last week and hoping to do it again. In this week have the WRs with their (Teams, POS, Tgts/Game, REC, REC Yds, Yds/tgt, Fantasy Points/Tgt, Fantasy Points/Rec, Catch%, Target Shares, along with the Corner Backs that SHOULD be facing the WR.

The CB stats include (Team, POS, Times Targeted, Yds/REC, YAC/GM, INT/TGTs, TD Allowed, QBR vs CB)

We have then gone through and either put the WR in Green who has PLUS match-ups against the opposing CB, or Red who has NEGATIVE match-ups against the opposing CB. Just because they are red doesn't mean that's a 'do not start' it's just historical matchups and how the CBs have faired against like WRs.

These aren't GUARANTEED to be the CB/WR in every single set because they can move around due to defense package etc but it's the projected ones. Not that you don't know that but just thought I'd put that out there for others to see as well because some might not know!

I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out why though. Is it because they aren‚Äôt predictable or upsets can happen from the teams knowing each other‚Äôs playbook so well? I‚Äôm just trying to understand what it is about divisional matchups that makes them different than a normal matchup. 


A specific example would be that I have Rams Defense this weekend and though on paper Rams should do well (high sack rate and did well against Seattle last two games), some people are steering fully clear because of the rivalry.

28,Hot Take: Melvin Gordon is a RB1 Next Year,Lurker5719263845,"I believe that Melvin Gordon is going to be a RB1 next year and will be a massive steal next year and I have 4 reasons to back it up



Mike Munchak and the Offensive line


Munchak has been one of the best offensive line coaches in the league. His offensive lines in Pittsburgh produced multiple RB1's. From 2014 to 2018, the Steelers had DeAngelo Williams, Le'Veon Bell and James Conner. Munchak is also doing good work in Denver. He's turned Garett Bolles from a liability into a tackle that Denver shelled out 17 Million a year for. I expect Munchak to keep up his great work in Denverp



Phillip Lindsay 


Lindsay has hindered Gordon's ability to break out. Fortunately, Lindsay is a RFA and there are many teams out there that could be in the market for a running back (Jets, Falcons, Steelers, etc) and the Broncos aren't one of them. With Lindsay gone, Gordon will be the 3 down back



Routes Run


Gordon is surprisingly high in routes run per game. He averages just above 17.5 routes run per game. For comparison, Dalvin Cook averages around 19 per game. And with the backfield just to himself next year, those numbers are bound to go up



Quarterback


The Broncos are most likely moving on from Drew Lock,   whether that be in the draft or free agency, this helps Gordon because the Broncos won't have to throw the ball 30-40 times a game",fantasyfootball,1,1608968332,kkeuqm,1

30,Aiyuk vs Hilton,Sleece_,"I am in week 2 of the championship game down 15 points. Last round I came back from a 40 point deficit to win in the second week (which was utterly insane and unexpected).

I'm starting Kittle at TE. I have Wilson at RB2 because he's been an animal when starting. The main problem is Aiyuk. If Kittle gets a lot of snaps, there goes Aiyuks production. But at the same time, SF could turn the ball over 4 times and only score 10 points. My other WR options are Calvin Ridley (starting duh), Cooper Kupp (flex), and TY Hilton. TY is either going to get me 5 points or 20. 

I guess to sum up all of this into one question, do I play Hilton or Aiyuk? Keep in mind I've got Kittle and Wilson starting so if I play Aiyuk, my match-up depends on the success of SF and their 3rd string QB.",fantasyfootball,1,1608967135,kken4u,1

As for those highly touted players who failed to live up to their pre-draft hype, Ruggs and Pittman, how do you feel about these guys going forward?

79,Josh Allen pros and cons week 16,StripedAApe,"Little worried about Josh Allen this week since he‚Äôs going against the NE defense which led to his low of the season. I‚Äôve constructed a pros and cons list of for those of you on the fence.

Pros:

* On a recent tear
* Nice way to finish the season
* Reliable
* Decent ceiling
* High floor
* Gilmore is out
* Allen was nursing an injury last time he played Pats
* Bad weather last time he played Pats
* Bill not playing his best lineup (sitting Cam Newton) maybe wants to get the rookies some experience?
* Pats aren‚Äôt fighting for anything
* Has played very well against best defenses before
* John brown might be back
* Bills might try to rub a blow out in Pats face

Cons:

* Facing The Hood
* Lowest score against them
* The Hood is coming for blood
* Bills have locked up their division, aren‚Äôt fighting for anything (could play a more conservative game)
* Pats have shut down the last 4 QBs they‚Äôve played (most of which were decent QBs)

81,Jalen Reagor Week 16 @DAL,JeopardyIsASport,"Haven‚Äôt seen a discussion post about Reagor  yet but he has no injury designation going into week 16. 

It is a soft ball matchup with a bottom 5 pass defense. 

He‚Äôs leading the team in WR targets since Hurts took over and Hurts looks GOOD as we all know. 

The downside? Raegor hasn‚Äôt topped 11 fantasy points once this year. This is essentially betting on his breakout game coming Sunday.

85,Tyler Boyd ruled OUT. Do we dare lean on Green?,Arbeanian,"For the people like me who are in super deep 14 man leagues and thin waivers, we have a dilemma.

Tyler Boyd is out so that means Higgins and Green will be the top WR for the bengals. Allen is also cleared to start at QB. Now I know it‚Äôs the bengals, but Houston isn‚Äôt that scary of a defense. I see them playing from behind a lot so that means a lot of passes.

McKissick: see above, in PPR I believe he is a viable play even with Gibson in as the Seahawk game script could favor a lot of passing.

Edmonds:  he‚Äôs been questionable all week and with a tough SF defense Arizona could have to pass a lot.

Surely someone else can do better. Sorry if this has triggered painful memories of what Williams did back then  


He would only touch the ball sixteen times that day. But that was enough.

Charles would finish the day with 8 carries for 20 yards, one rushing TD.

(Huh.)

And 8 receptions on 8 targets for 195 yards receiving, four receiving TDs.

(Oh.)

[Just watch the video.](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000298651/Week-15-Jamaal-Charles-highlights) Or [a longer video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNn2zMxEsZQ)

Doing the math, that's 2.0 + 6 + 19.5 + (4 \* 6) = 51.5 in standard, 55,5 in 0.5 PPR, 59.5 in 1.0 PPR.

Drafted pretty poorly, missed out on most of the big WW pickups, but week over week ended up getting here. Each week I kinda lamented over not picking up some big WW guys and making a few dumb drops of guys dominating now (Aiyuk). But then you think about it, and maybe the guy who picked up those guys had a chain of events where it ended up getting you the record you got, the playoff seed you got, etc. Or maybe if you had kept them, you would have gotten a different seed and lost, etc.

Example, ended up with #3 seed and scored a pedestrian 120 week 13 but #6 opponent scored only 70, while the #7 (who #2 played) scored 160. If I had won one more game and gotten #2 seed, would have been knocked out.

He had a couple huge weeks, but his floor is low and frequent regardless of his ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Cut‚Äù status until recently. 

What are your thoughts on playing him this week against the Rams? I am currently planning on playing Rashard Higgins (facing Jets) in his place in the Flex position. Debating this heavily based on projections, but my gut says keep him off the team this week. 

Unfortunately (but thankfully until now) I also have the currently questionable James Robinson. May need to flex Tee Higgins or Gronk in his spot instead (Kelce is my TE).

Facing opponents in the top half of the league offensively, they‚Äôve underwhelmed greatly. Carolina is around or slightly better than league average offensively.. they are also coming off a loss with a long week to prepare. I anticipate them moving the ball pretty well.

With that being said, I‚Äôm really curious to hear from you guys about what has helped you. Do you listen to podcasts, subscribe to fantasy websites, use this sub Reddit or just look at ESPN rankings and articles?",fantasyfootball,1,1608917545,kk2o0g,1
27,Maximizing Your (Kickoff) Return on Investment: Week 16,Chronik_Liar,"Good morning and happy holiday season return yards players! Coming at you to help with any championship decisions you might have. As always these posts are targeted for people who are in leagues that score return yards with the preferred scoring being 1 point per 10 return yards.

After thinking about it the last couple of weeks, I have unfortunately decided to hang up the keyboard and announce my retirement. It‚Äôs been a little tougher this year with work and personal reasons that it doesn‚Äôt seem sustainable for me to continue. For you week 17 championship players, I‚Äôm still going to roll out a week 17 post and I‚Äôll also still be posting the projections next year on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SLFootballGuys) so feel free to follow. If you have any interest of checking out my buddies and I giving our good and bad NFL gambling takes, check out our podcast. We may not be the best, but we sure have fun with it! Finally, if I have helped you in the past, I would ask for you to consider donating to a cause that hits home to me through the [Crohn‚Äôs &amp; Colitis Foundation.](https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/) They have done great work in research and support of people affected by various forms of IBD. I understand this is a tough time for most people and donations aren‚Äôt on the top of people‚Äôs list right now, but I would appreciate your consideration!

Well, enough of the rant, onto the week 15 recap:

Our luck of multiple punt return touchdowns ran out as the only special teams touchdown we saw was CeeDee Lamb, who turned a San Francisco onside kick into a score. That‚Äôs not to say that it was a weak week for returners, as there were plenty of guys who finished close to 100 yards in total return yards. Specifically, returners that scored triple digits in return yards were Jamal Agnew, Nsimba Webster, and Andre Roberts.

[Here are the projections for week 16.](https://twitter.com/SLFootballGuys/status/1342146320296009732/photo/1) 

**Good Returners for Week 16:**

*Ray-Ray McCloud (KR/PR)* ‚Äì Just like the rest of the Steelers team, McCloud has been a little quiet lately. This looks like a good opportunity for him as the Colts are one of the worst teams in terms of touchback percentage on the year. If he can get going in the return game, he may be able to carry that momentum into his offensive role and be a solid flex with good upside.

*Kenjon Barner (KR/PR)* ‚Äì Barner came close to making the recap this week as he racked up 99 total return yards against his former Falcons side. This week he has a great shot on breaking triple digits against a Detroit team that challenges returners to return kicks against them. In this projected high scoring game, Barner should have a safe floor as a good deep league option.

*Darrynton Evans (KR)* ‚Äì If Kalif Raymond is still out, Evans can be a solid play on Sunday night. Green Bay has been the seventh worst team in touchback percentage over the last 3 games and have been worse at home compared to away. I wouldn‚Äôt speculate Evans getting another late garbage time touchdown like last week, but he looks like he‚Äôs being involved in the offense and can make a solid game out of it.

**Returners I‚Äôm Fading Week 16:**

*Jamal Agnew (KR/PR)* ‚Äì Agnew had a great week as he topped the list in total return yards this past week with 115 total return yards. Unfortunately, he has a tough matchup against a Tampa Bay side that has not allowed a kickoff to be returned over the last 3 games.

Hope you all have a great holiday weekend and may you all bring home the title!",fantasyfootball,1,1608917249,kk2l8y,1

We have a fantastic 3 game slate that has some terrific plays for both season-long championship players and DFS players alike. Let‚Äôs dig in and help you bring home the bacon this Saturday!

QBs:

Looking into our Match-Up Tool, you can see Tom Brady has the best Match-Up, on paper, for QBs as the Detroit Lions‚Äô defense gives up the most amount of FPPG to opposing QBs. The Bucs are currently a -10 point favorite with an Over/Under of 54. With all of Brady‚Äôs passing options are healthy and good to go, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see him have a MASSIVE day and lead a lot of people to the promised land. On the flip side of this, if playing DFS, you could throw in Stafford and pair with Marvin Jones Jr or Cephus and hope they are down a ton and have to throw the ball 50+ times.

RBs:

Digging into the RBs we see that the Lions also give up the most amount of FP to opposing RBs. With Jones out again with Covid, Fournette is the go-to guy. He could be vultured by Ke-Shawn Vaughn or LeSean McCoy but they haven‚Äôt been super effective this year. I still think you‚Äôre going to get exactly what you expect out of Fournette. With the Raiders giving up the 2nd most amount of FP that leads us straight to Gaskin and Ahmed. I‚Äôm not 100% sure how Gaskin will go coming off Covid as it can affect people differently. Hopefully, we don‚Äôt get told Gaskin is starting and then BAM we get Edwards-Helaired and he doesn‚Äôt touch the ball once.

QB, RB, WR, TE, Red Zone Passes, Red Zone Rushes, and Red Zone Receptions. In each category, we have how many Fantasy Points Per Game the defense has given up, who their opponent is, and how many fantasy points per game the team has accrued so far in 2020. Along with that, we have every stat you need to find the perfect match-ups this weekend. Whether you're playing season-long or DFS, this matchup tool has the most stats that will help out. Will update the PIT/BAL players once the game is played and stats are up to date!

***Again, this chart isn't optimized for mobile so it's best to open it up on a desktop with the many stats and columns the tables have. Just a heads up. ***

86,Emmanuel Sanders will be a WR1 today,AMZN2THEMOON,"As many of you know, Emmanuel is a name given to Jesus Christ, which coincidentally is what Emmanuel Sanders will be for your fantasy team today. The bible predicts a massive game from Emmanuel through the parables of catching ""fish"". Emmanuel has been brought to us by the power of the Saints, so you can expect a Godly performance on Christmas Day.  


The OG Emmanuel was a renowned fisherman, in one instance telling his disciples to cast their nets on the other side of their ship, where they catch about a million fish. Due to this prediction, it is clear that after a rough opening drive for our boy Manny, he will encourage Brees to throw at him, and be force fed the ball for a massive day thereafter.  


In another bile story, OG Manny turned a few fish into enough for 5,000 people. Clearly this is a prediction that Emmanuel Sanders will be turning a short Drew Brees dump off into a 50+ yard house call to rouse the 5,000 covid friendly Saints fans who will be present for the game.  


Knowing Sanders will be targeted frequently and successfully, including at least one 50+ yard TD, I predict a statline of 11/160/1 for 33 PPR points.

1,FF Theme Team Names and how would you stack them?,donslaughter,"I was looking at my roster today and noticed that a lot of my players' first names start with the letter D. So I thought ""What if I make a team where everyone's name started with the letter D? I could call it GIVE 'EM THE D and stream DSTs as needed (because they're all the D, obviously)"". Here's the lineup I came up with:

* QB: Deshaun Watson
* WR1: DeAndre Hopkins
* WR2: Davante Adams
* RB1: Derrick Henry
* RB2: Dalvin Cook
* TE: Darren Waller
* Flex: David Montgomery
* K: Daniel Carlson
* DST: Dolphins

Given his adp, he has definitely helped us get to the ship, but are we trusting him to get us all the way? His efficiency has gone down quite a bit since chubb came back, and the browns simply dont pass to the rb very often unless they are down (which will be unlikely here). I feel hunt needs to score a td during one of his few opportunities or else he‚Äôll be a huge bust. He is tough to bench because he is just talented and could always make a big play. Thoughts?

For me, he would go 1.01. But this year, with RBs like kamara, Henry, and cook all doing amazing, is there any possible way they go over him? Also, where does saquon go? Does he still go top 5? I think if cmc goes 1.01, kamara goes 1.02, then cook, then Henry.

40,Ready to get Hurts again?,StripedAApe,"Got Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts this week. Since this is my championship game I‚Äôve been researching all day. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come up with: 

Josh Allen
Pros:
* On a recent tear
* Nice way to finish the season
* Reliable
* Decent ceiling
* High floor
* Gilmore is out
* Injured last time he played Pats
* Bad weather last time he played Pats
* Bill not playing his best lineup (sitting Cam Newton) maybe wants to get the rookies some experience?
* Pats aren‚Äôt fighting for anything
* Has played very well against best defenses before
* John brown might be back
Cons:
* Facing The Hood
* Lowest score against them
* The Hood is coming for blood
* Bills have locked up their division, aren‚Äôt fighting for anything (could play a more conservative game)
* Pats have shut down the last 4 QBs they‚Äôve played (most of which were decent QBs)

Jalen Hurts
Pros:
* Great last two games
* Great matchup
* High ceiling
* Playing for his right to game
* Possible decent floor
* Dallas isn‚Äôt playing for anything (already out of division)
* Eagles aren‚Äôt eliminated yet
* While Jalen Hurts had 338 yards, 3 tds, 63 yards rushing, 1 rush td vs Arizona; A large portion of that production came in the first half including the 3 passing tds
Cons:
* Small sample size
* Awful offense
* Low floor
* Wild card
* After halftime adjustments, Jalen took 5 sacks and fumbled twice which Philly fortunately recovered.  Their lone 2nd half td came on the back of two pass interfence calls.  Arizona has been the most penalized team in the NFL this year.
* Dallas has been awful against the run this year, however this is more likely to benefit Miles Sanders than Hurts, they have allowed 30.83 fantasy points vs RBs the last 4 weeks

I‚Äôm thinking Josh Allen because he‚Äôs gotten me this far. Part of me thinks you don‚Äôt win championships by taking unnecessary risks. But the other part of me is saying you don‚Äôt win by sitting on your hands. I think I‚Äôd sleep better at night knowing I lost with Allen though.

Regardless of the outcome, I will be upset. I can‚Äôt get over Davante Adams to be completely honest with you.

If I have an early pick next year, I know it would be stupid of me not to draft a top 5 rb (cmc, henry, kamara, cook, chubb). But i‚Äôll guaranteed lose adams if I do so.

84,Brown D/ST Week 16,ayoderby,"So the D/ST start of the week seems to be the Browns against the Jets, how we all feeling? Like any average defense with a good matchup, I think there is huge potential for a boom or bust here. At the moment I'm feeling like the bust end is more likely. 

Yes, the Jets have allowed the most points for defenses this season. However, Sam Darnold is starting to be consistently healthy and has been slowly improving the last few games. I also believe he is more than talented enough to be an NFL franchise QB. Don't forget that the Jets probably should have ridden through a win vs. the Patriots, scoring 27, and their D-Coordinator literally handed a W to the Raiders, scoring 28. Despite the negative perception, the Jets have been able to move the ball especially against bad or average defenses. They are a decent O-Line, and allowed only 2 sacks against one of the best D-Lines in the Rams. Ever since their bye, the maximum amount of sacks in a game they have allowed is 3. Their O-Line allows for decent run play. They quietly have a pretty good WR corps, in Crowder, Mims, and Perriman. Darnold has had success finding wide open receivers.

The Browns have been a fairly average to low performing defense with a few booms.  They almost always allow over 20 points a game, except from week 8 to week 11 (16, 7, 17 points) where the weather at home in Cleveland was literally impossible for offenses to work in. They did have a solid showing last week against a backup quarterback of the NYG, allowing only 6 points (probably more if Joe Judge didn't go for it on 4th so often). Myles Garrett is a big part of how this defense performs, however his performance has suffered after his COVID diagnose, and said after the Giants game that he had a coughing fit and was still struggling.

If this was a matchup against the Jags or Bengals I might feel a little differently; however they did play Jacksonville only a few weeks ago, allowing 25 points, getting no sacks or turnovers and racking up -1.0 fantasy points. As meme-worthy as this Jets team has been this year, I do not think the talent they have with decent play calling from Gase at times should be underestimated.

85,NFL Players SHOULD Care About Our Fantasy Teams. Because Without Fantasy They Would Be Making Much Less Money,Dani3lh11,"Fantasy football is an $18.6 billion market.

That's $6 billion more than the current estimated NFL revenue, and 4.5 times the current value of the NFL's top flight team, the Dallas Cowboys. In other words, fantasy football might be more valuable than the real thing.

Tons of people like me wouldn‚Äôt be watching  Colts versus Dolphins games for instance if it wasn‚Äôt for Fantasy. 

NFL teams revenue is positively influenced by Fantasy Football. https://scholarworks.uark.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=econuht

37,Pump the breaks bold prediction: Jalen Hurts is average this week,-Action-,"First off, I'm a little nervous that EVERY SINGLE podcast &amp; FF news outlet has the same narrative on Hurts right now: ""You start him over everyone not named Mahomes right now"".  Everyone is banking on another 30+ pt game from him and situations like this just feel like it's going to be an ultimate letdown.  I can see it now, Jalen puts up 17 pts and everyone on social media attacks him saying ""YOU COST ME A CHAMPIONSHIP!"".  Some things to take note of to temper your expectations:

* While Jalen Hurts had 338 yards, 3 tds, 63 yards rushing, 1 rush td vs Arizona; A large portion of that production came in the first half including the 3 passing tds.  After halftime adjustments, Jalen took 5 sacks and fumbled twice which Philly fortunately recovered.  Their lone 2nd half td came on the back of two pass interfence calls.  Arizona has been the most penalized team in the NFL this year.
* Philly controlled the clock a season-high 32 minutes vs a fast-paced Cardinals team, they normally average 28:54 in time of possession, in their previous matchup vs Dallas, they had the ball only 27:10 minutes
* Philly ran 79 plays vs Arizona! They average 66 per game.  In their matchup vs the Saints, Hurts first start, they ran exactly 66 plays.  In their previous matchup vs Dallas, 58 plays.
* Dallas has been a top 10 defense all year in passing yards allowed, allowing just 221 yards per game
* Dallas is the #1 defense at not allowing first downs through the air
* Dallas has allowed just 16.82 fantasy points vs QBs the last 4 weeks
* Dallas has been awful against the run this year, however this is more likely to benefit Miles Sanders than Hurts, they have allowed 30.83 fantasy points vs RBs the last 4 weeks
* This is still the Doug Pederson Eagles, they have been poorly coached, bad play calling and awful pretty much all year, do you really trust this staff to put it all together in your championship week?
* On the other side of the ball, its now the Tony Pollard show for Dallas instead of the plodding Zeke, there's a game script where Dallas controls the clock much more effeciently this game
* The Arizona game was a close game all the way to the final whistle, Philly is favored vs Dallas so its likely Hurts doesn't get those garbage time fantasy points this time around.

Overall, I like Jalen Hurts, the football fan in me wants me to see him become a superstar.  I picked him up in my leagues for championship week but hes still likely riding the bench in favor of some other options.  I don't think hes quite the slam dunk that people expect him to be for fantasy this week.  He's still a rookie in his 3rd start ever.  From the limited data we have, he seems far likely more likely to be a regression candidate this week than sustain what he did in Arizona.  The game scripts likely won't be in his favor for fantasy purposes as much.  I can very much see a stat line closer to what he produced vs the Saints.  Make your decisions accordingly.",fantasyfootball,1,1608841903,kjma15,1

Some classic examples I recall were Steve Smith vs the Panthers and Favre vs the Vikings. There was so much to those situations other than that was the last team they played on.

An example for WR would be Mr. Don‚Äôt sit me - AKA - Keenan Allen and playing Ty Johnson along with Keenan incase Keenan gets limited reps or gets re-injured.

The default WR1 with Drew Brees against Min seems like a solid spot and I would rank him as a middle of the pack WR2. However I‚Äôm seeing him more in the Wr3/flex discussion in the QBlist and the Primer articles, for instance. 

For instance, to paraphrase The Primer:  Sanders performed above expectations last week, will likely not see Dantzler shadow coverage and will likely go up against soft corner coverage. He is expected to see at least 5 targets.  Then the summary is ‚Äú...in the WR3 conversation this week against this banged-up secondary‚Äù 

The WR3 conversation? A plus very matchup, a reasonable expected target share, and opposing offense that can score, a proven history as a receiver, and we even saw last week that NO will take deep shots with him. What about this situation implies anything less than WR2 performance?  Is it just age?  Or how Brees looked last week? 

I can generally see why players are ranked where they are... but this one doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Is there more to this story?

96,"Pitch: ABC's The Bachelor, but it's a 16-team guillotine league instead.",SontagWrong,"# The Pitch

People love ABC's *The Bachelor.*

Over the course of its 23rd season, *The Bachelor* amassed 6.55 million viewers. People became emotionally invested in Colton Underwood's valiant quest to find true love, dedicating genuine hours to the show. Simply put, there's a market for watching drunken, attractive idiots play Russian roulette with their lives.

Now, instead of two dozen twenty-something supermodels, imagine yourself‚Äîa drunk, sweaty, hairy fatass‚Äîcompeting for a $1,000,000 cash prize in a 16-team guillotine league. Now imagine competing against fifteen other lads in Los Angeles' most luxurious mansion, being a jive dumbass for all of America to see. At home, laugh alongside every other American as you watch Jeff from Notre Dame draft Michael Thomas over Derrick Henry; Edgar from Finance &amp; Consulting start Jared Goff over Jalen Hurts; cry as Constantine from the Yakuza wins it all. What do you say?

# The Setup

Take the classic 16-team guillotine league and project it onto *The Bachelor's* format. I'm projecting eighteen episodes: one draft, sixteen weeks, and one victory celebration. In the first episode, we learn about the most tragic backstories before the draft. We'd pull out all the stops: Richie lost his arm in a tragic stevedoring accident; LaDaniel plays FF on an iPhone 3; Jerry was an English major. And each week, the lowest-scoring lad gets eliminated (to spice things up, we will use an actual guillotine). 

Consider the best mansion in Beverly Hills. Now add sixteen jackasses, stock the bar with complementary absinthe, and implement a dozen flat-screen TVs and see just what the fuck happens. We'd have it all each week: waiver decisions, setting the lineup, the drama of watching the game. Might Benjamin rage-launch a bowling ball through the flatscreen after Corey Davis goose-eggs him? We don't know, but there will be bowling balls in the house! 

When it's down to the final four, we'll fly them all out to their studs. Watch intently as Johnny from Bridgeport, Connecticut bitch slaps T.J. Hockenson for his week 15 dud. Cuddle with your significant other as Isaac from the National Auctioneer Association vainly massages Derek Carr's groin. And finally, feel your heartstrings tugged as John Hopkins from Johns Hopkins risks it all for a taste of Davante Adams.

The winner will, of course, take home $1,000,000 and a prostitute of their choosing.

do you just love fantasy so much you can't stop playing even after you've lost?

I get that you want to play all 16 weeks and put up the most points you can each week. But in **what other competitive game exists in this world where an eliminated players is still allowed to participate** and possibly mess up the competitive balance of a league?

For example, in Poker, once you're busted or eliminated, are you allowed to still sit at the table and mess with the dealer and remaining players, continue to play for fun, or go whisper to other players what cards you folded?

only reason im asking is because there is a HUGE conflict of interest in the lost/eliminated teams still participating and can pick up or drop players to hurt/help the remaining teams. I get this is fantasy, but would it make a ton of sense to not let any players who have nothing to gain financially still actively influence games that DO have financial implications?",fantasyfootball,1,1608830449,kjj1s3,1

**Who do you like in this matchup?**

Post your team‚Äôs matchup and let others predict who they think will win.  If you‚Äôre in a Survivor, Eliminator or Weekly Pick ‚ÄòEm game, post those too!  If you have a weekly challenge that your commissioner runs, let us know what it is and if you have a clever plan in mind on how to win it. Be sure to give whole roster and scoring details when applicable.  We encourage everyone to give feedback to others on their matchups and ask that you try to briefly explain your pick or reasoning when you give advice.  

**Please do not post screenshots of your matchups.**

Discussion is welcome about the real life football game matchups too; have a big divisional game this week or is your favorite team facing the #1 defense in the league?  Post your thoughts on that matchup too but just remember the rules about being nice to others; being a fan doesn‚Äôt give you an excuse to behave rudely to rival fans or people who have a rooting interest against your matchup.

He can be plugged in as a risky flex play with a potentially very high ceiling",fantasyfootball,1,1608822266,kjgu81,1
64,Tony pollard or James Connor?,beardface909,"I'm in the championship game partly because of Tony pollard last week (picked him up 5 mins before game time). Is there any info on Zeke? 

It's looking like James Connor is going to play,  but I don't know how much to expect from him coming back from the injury coupled with how effective Snell was last week.",fantasyfootball,1,1608822117,kjgspz,1
65,Mark Andrews,bsweenz,"The dude is a stud. You know it and I know it. Even with missing 3 games he‚Äôs still a top 5 scoring TE (which isn‚Äôt saying much this year all things considered). The question is whether or not we can trust the Baltimore passing offense to keep him relevant enough to start him. Is he a for sure start or do you look elsewhere if you don‚Äôt have Kelce, Kittle, Waller? I‚Äôve been rocking with Tonyan, but Andrews does have the best upside.",fantasyfootball,1,1608822023,kjgrt9,1
66,Are you starting Corey Davis on Sunday?,TylerAdams_,"With regards to fantasy, perhaps one of the most hit or miss wide-outs in the whole NFL has been Corey Davis, without a doubt. He's done great against both good and bad defenses, and he's also dropped duds against both good and bad defenses.

For example- 

\*0.5ppr scoring format for this post\*

Oct. 25 vs. PIT \[#2 in the NFL in both yards per play and points scored against\]: 6 Rec, 35 Rec Yds, 1 Rec TD - good for 12.5 points

Dec. 13 @ JAX \[#30 in the NFL in points scored against and WORST in the NFL in yards per play allowed\]: 3 Rec, 34 Rec Yds, 0 Rec TD, 1 Fum Lost - good for 2.90 points

Clearly, Davis has been inconsistent this year. This has benefitted some that have rolled with him week in and week out, but this has also screwed those same people over when he drops a random dud.

The main reason that I raise the question in the title of my post is because of the situation this Sunday. The red-hot Titans face a Packers' defense that has also been hit or miss. One of the pieces in that defense that has been a 'hit' in virtually every game this year has been their star cornerback Jaire Alexander. Last week in Saturday's contest that brought the Carolina Panthers up to Green Bay, Alexander, more or less, canceled out Robby Anderson, who has been Carolina's hottest receiver for a large part of this season. He held Anderson to 2 Rec, 21 Rec Yds, and 0 TDs, which was good for 3.00 points due to a lone rushing attempt that lost yardage.

DJ Moore, the more inconsistent of the Panther's group of receivers, was largely receiving coverage from Packers' cornerback not named Jaire Alexander. Because of this, Moore went for 6 Rec, 131 Rec Yds, and 0 TDs, which equated to 16.20 points with his rushing attempt that gained yardage.

Obviously, not being the WR1 on a team has its perks when playing against the Packers. In the Titans' case, AJ Brown owns that crown. Could the Titans' receivers end up scoring in a similar manner to the Panthers' on this most recent Saturday. Only time will tell.

I once again raise the question - Are you starting Corey Davis on Sunday?",fantasyfootball,1,1608821337,kjgln9,1

For those of you lucky enough to be in it, what player are you starting that has no business being on a championship team?",dschneider,"After running a weird rotation of Derek Carr, Taysom Hill, and Cam Newton all season, I've got Mitch Trubisky in at QB with all the money on the line.

69,Week 17 Championship participants: what D/ST are you eyeing to roll out?,AyLognog,"If you got here, it‚Äôs likely you have your MIA, LAR, NO, IND, BAL, PIT etc., but if your league has a 2 week championship like mine (first year in it), you probably aren‚Äôt going to run the same D/ST in 17 as you are 16, and I haven‚Äôt seen much on the sub about stashes and plays for week 17. Of course BAL is an exception here, against CIN.

NE looks to be a decent play against a NYJ team that can‚Äôt afford another win. But there‚Äôs also PHI against WFT.

I have CLE and LAR now, but neither of their week 17s are appealing to roll with.

However, and after an injury scare, he came back and looked fairly reliable for 5 weeks, until last week, where he received less touches than Chase Edmonds, despite being limited on practices throughout the previous week. It's also worth noting that Kyler Murray does not have a single TD pass to Drake this season and that Edmonds is clearly their pass catching back. With this said and with a matchup against the 49ers in what is going to be most people's final week, is he going to be reliable again or should owners look somewhere else?",fantasyfootball,1,1608818125,kjfths,1

So I went through my fantasy football related text msgs from this season, and eventhough I've made it to the championship, the most enjoyable part of this season is everyone of my friends that asked me for advice and either improved or straight up it the ""Ship"" in their respective leagues. Shouts to Jenny, Sean, Jeff, Derek, and Brad ....whom I'm playing against for the title (fuck you now, you'rededtome).

Phillips has a 63, and just came off IR from a groin injury two weeks ago. He didn't practice today (Wednesday)

Do we know which Texans WR will be matched up against Jackson and who will go against Phillips or his replacement? I'm assuming Jackson will go against either Cooks or Coutee, but he may play slot corner I'm not even sure.

However, in the Baltimore game two weeks ago, he put up a whopping 25 points. This week, the Browns face off against the Jets, which seems to be a blowout in favor of the Browns, resulting in a positive game script for the Browns. (unless the Jets magically resurge under Sam Darnold) The positives are the Jets do not have star defensive tackle Quinnen Williams. They still do have star nose tackle Fotorunso Fatukasi, who is one of the best run stuffing nose tackles in the league. Do we start Hunt or do we sit Hunt?

9,WFT RBs in Week 16,JdeFalconr,"I'm having difficulty with the projections I'm seeing for Washington's RBs this week who are not named Antonio Gibson, namely McKissic and I wanted to put my thoughts and some data up for discussion. I am by no means a fantasy expert, I just know how to  use Excel to export tables to CSV, do a find/replace with Notepad++, and make tables in Reddit. Credit to [fantasypros.com](www.fantasypros.com) for the player data.

First some stats about Carolina and RBs in 2020; stats are average per game:

Rush Att|Rush Yds|Rush TD|Recs|Rec Yds|Rec TD|Rec Tar|Pts
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
21.6 (16th)|104.4 (23rd)|0.8 (19th)|5.9 (26th)|38.9 (20th)|0.1 (14th) |7.2 (23rd)|25.3 (26th)

And here are some stats comparing Gibson and McKissic this season:

Some conclusions I would suggest we can draw from this data:

* Gibson's quantity of rushing attempts seems to negatively correlate with McKissic's point production. Maybe that's obvious but it has some connotations because...
* I would argue McKissic's production is dependent upon game situation. The games where McKissic has fewer points seem to be big wins (Week 7, 11, 12) or bad losses (Week 2, 3, 4). Gibson is present for some of McKissic's higher-scoring weeks (Week 6, 9, 10) so while the two leach carries off each other they can both still be productive while sharing the field.
* Carolina is not a good defense against the rush. They are poor but not garbage against receiving backs.

I am more hesitant than ever to start McKissic in the league championship. McKissic's value has always been in receptions. The game will hopefully be a blowout which I'd think favors Gibson rushing to kill the clock, not throwing to McKissic for yardage in late downs. Week 12 is my fear where Gibson plows them and McKissic doesn't even get sloppy seconds. I don't know that Haskins will be as eager to check down to McKissic  this week given that Carolina ranks 25th with a 4.53% sack rate and a 19.0% pressure rate (22nd), a far cry from last week against the Seahawks.

It's crazy that nearly all the mid round receivers(4-6) that weren't injured had very good value. The only healthy busts were Juju/Chark/Lockett in that ADP. 

I also think a lot of people that took the elite D/ST, and kickers early look foolish in hindsight as well. As long as you do your research, you can stream these options and get nearly the same value. There are a ton of hidden gems late in the draft(Diontae/Gibson/Jefferson/Hockenson/Dobbins) that could be missed if you take a D/ST/Kicker in say rounds 8-9. A NFL is such a volatile league by nature that the elite defenses and kickers from the year prior generally don't live up to their draft status.",fantasyfootball,1,1608777698,kj72cg,1

31,Antonio Brown fits the mould of the WRs that have burned DET,neverhaveiever23,"Where were you when AB, of all players in 2020, delivered fantasy ships?

Detroit has conceded the most points of any football team: 435. This is in no small part because teams are willing to take deep shots regularly and also cause Stafford slings, it can run up the score (TB secondary is a huge weakness). 

A lot of the beneficiaries of teams playing Det have been wr2s or guys that are great deep threats:

Isabella 4-47-2 (hopkins still ate 10-137)
Trequan Smith 4-54-2 (Sanders 6-93)
Keelan Cole 6-143
Ridley 5-69-1 (julio 8-97)
DJ Moore 7-127  (Samuel 8-70-1) 
Fuller 6-171-2 (cooks 5-85)
MVS  6-85-1 (Adams 7-115-1)
Corey Davis 4-110-1 (Brown 5-44-1)

I realise Mike Evans fits this mode of a deep threat, and Godwin to some extent. I believe the pie will be big enough for at least 2 mouths to eat as you can see from the wr1s in brackets. I realise fuller was the wr1 but his deep ball speciality is worth noting. 

The points total is arrowing to a shootout with a high implied total of 54.5. It rarely surpasses 54.5. Dome is nice too. 

TB regularly runs up the score. Theyve scored 35 or more 4 times. They're one of 7 teams to have scored over 400 points this season. 

Yes AB's snap count is worrying. But his targets are encouraging. However, there is no doubt this is a high risk play with AB's ECR in the 30s. 

If you're looking for tremendous upside, AB could catch two streaks and put up a Will Fulleresque line of 7-150-2. Otherwise, his floor is 5-45-0.",fantasyfootball,1,1608775136,kj6e56,1

45,"I've just been banned by Sleeper, DynastyFF, and Fantasy_Football subreddits after getting attention from posting this.",allbasicman,"I can't believe I am forced to resort to reddit for help, but I have no choice. At this same time yesterday, I ran 2 leagues on the sleeper app. One was free and one was paid. I still have 12 members on my paid league who have paid $20 each and are drafting and probably have no clue what has happened yet. I recently joined a fantasy basketball league and paid $10 for a 22-Person League. Since I joined I was harassed and bullied for being a 76ers fan but I didn't take it too serious until today. Today, I was bullied for being a gay man and called the f slur multiple times and told you hang myself and burn in hell. I was bullied all day and sexualized in really hurtful ways. Then, an account came in the league with the same username and profile as me (my name was ItzNotAJ and his name was ItzNotAJ [except his name had a lowercase L as the first letter and mine is an uppercase i] and started spamming the f slur to chat and left immediately. Then, the main bully ss those messages and sent them to sleeper and said I was the one being homophobic and rude (this was after i threaten to report them all to sleeper and sent a request to sleeper and leaguesafe). League safe responded quickly and sent the requests to sleeper, but I'm convinced a sleeper mod is involved with them, since they randomly closed my bullying case and refused to listen to my contact request. They keep banning my online session anytime I try to contact them and it's the same moderator. I have no got my account removed about an hour ago. And now all my paid league members have no idea and these guys get away with everything with no help from Sleeper. I have the ss of the Sleeper admin who refuses to acknowledge my side and sides with them, I have the screenshots of them bullying me, and I have the screenshots of the requests. If anyone out there works for LeagueSafe or Sleeper Please help me.

I also have the screenshots of the duplicate account sending me vulgar messages (you can't even message yourself and if they checked the system they would see there is two account with similar names).

Please someone help me, if you work for any of those companies do something.",fantasyfootball,1,1608770277,kj53zb,1

This thread is similar to the current Trade thread that is found in our [Daily INDEX](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/search?q=author%3AFFBot+Index+flair%3Aindex&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day), but this one will also give people a chance to discuss fantasy trading in general, strategies on how to approach trades, advice on what you can do to make your trade sound enticing to the other person, post and discuss fantasy experts articles about trade values, bounce ideas off each other for what sort of trade values they think players have right now, or potential down the road trade targets to start considering.  

If you're looking for feedback on a trade, please include the following info in your post:

Shady crap like that. Do you have any amazing stories of personal relationships/beefs coming into play in your league? I have so many but don't want to make the post too personal...

His Last 4 Weeks:

wk13 @.TEN: 10targets, 8/62/1 - 20.4ppr Points

wk15 @.NYG: 8targets, 7/61/1 - 19.1ppr Points

Besides an average week 14 outing, he has been on fire. With all the recent excitement over guys like Brandon Aiyuk, I figured I'd shed some light on another guy who has been turning it up for fantasy owners when it matters most. This week he plays a Jets defense that looked surprisingly good last week, but allowed 40 points to Seattle just 2 weeks ago.

He's certainly played well over the past 1.5 games. But I think we need to slow the hype train down a little bit. The Cowboys will be fighting for their playoff chances against an arch-divisional rival and I don't expect their defense to be the sieve that it was in the early part of the season. Let's also bear in mind that Hurts had some lucky plays last week that probably aren't going to be repeated (like the long screen pass that went in for a TD against the Cards).  

Feel free and downvote me if you want but all of this Jalen Hurts talk is starting to remind me of the Alexander Mattison hype earlier this season. Will Hurts play decently this week? Probably, especially considering it's against the Cowboys. But is that 100% guaranteed? No.

Hurts still misses easy throws and will be further developing in the offseason. He's a project QB, which is why he wasn't the 1x01 overall in the draft. So the fact that people are talking about benching guys like Allen, Lamar and Tannehill for him is insane IMO.",fantasyfootball,1,1608757334,kj18pr,1

19,The Ahmed/Gaskin Situation,gpngc,"\*If for some reason (it's 2020) one of them is ruled out, obviously the other becomes a great play, and this post is useless.     

**Here's what we know:**   

* Gaskin is off the COVID list and practicing.
* Gaskin and Ahmed have not been active in the same game all season.  There is no way to be confident in what the split will be without a report or quote from a beat writer or reporter.    
* Gaskin beat out Ahmed at University of Washington AND earlier this year.    
* Ahmed has a 4.6 YPC and 2 rushing TDs this year.  Gaskin has a 3.9 YPC and 2 rushing TDs this year.   
* Yes, I know YPC is not a great stat.  However, my eye test says Ahmed has been a better runner quite clearly, and there are no statistics that prove otherwise.   
* In Ahmed's great 100-yd game last week, even Matt Brieda ran wild.   
* Gaskin has been a more productive pass-catcher.   
* Gaskin has lost a fumble in each of his past two games.    
* The Dolphins have been quite secretive and annoying when it comes to playing time/injuries this season.   

The bottom line is that either or both are incredibly risky plays UNLESS we get a quote or report from a beat writer.  Yes, Gaskin has been the workhorse in every game he's played since Week 2.  But since that time Ahmed has emerged as the more productive rusher.  Gaskin has also fumbled in each of his last two games.  Miami has favored a workhorse approach for most games (not all) this season, but it makes a lot of sense to have Gaskin be the passing down back and split work 50/50.     

The fact that Rotoworld is declaring Gaskin a high-end RB2 at this point in time is absurd.",fantasyfootball,1,1608752456,kizqgv,1

It‚Äôs been working well so far, but it‚Äôs just been based on individual accuracy.

Thought it‚Äôd be fun for the holiday week, to instead of having it just be everyone ranking for themselves, creating teams of 2, and having the teams compete against each other to see which team is more accurate.

The two teams I have in mind for this first challenge is Reddit v Radio.  There are 2 users who do Sports Radio in the Detroit area that have been setting their rankings ([The DTM Squatch](https://twitter.com/DanLeach971) and [JeffRiger](https://twitter.com/riger1984)) and are game for the challenge idea.  I reached out to Redditor u/PeakedInHighSkool and he‚Äôs in to represent Team Reddit, so I‚Äôm creating this post as an open tryout if you will, to see if there are any other redditors that would like to be a part of the challenge and represent Team Reddit.

To make things interesting, in addition to the $100 that goes to the most accurate individual rankings (doesn‚Äôt have to be in this challenge), going to give $100 to the team that wins this challenge (so $50 per teammate).

70,Commissioners Court,Fredo_pie,"Commissioners of Reddit, I‚Äôm a commissioner for a league (10 team standard) and also in the championship game this week. Our league does a four team play off over two weeks. It‚Äôs been our etiquette for years to stop making waiver transactions unless you‚Äôre in the run for the trophy (we don‚Äôt have $ for 2nd or 3rd). Two teams were eliminated from the playoffs last week (and is not on the game for third) used a waiver on qb j. hurts had a higher waiver than both teams playing for first so neither had a chance to grab him. 

I should have locked teams but no one has ever snatched up guys in week 16 before unless they were still in. Even if I had locked non playoff teams he still technically is a playoff team as of the time he put the waiver but not any more as there is only two teams left.

I told him about it and used the rationale of seeing the season though strong. Which is great but just use the guys you have IMO. He‚Äôd understood the violation of etiquette and agreed the transaction was out of place (although technically allowed by the software). 

My question is what is the best way to set this right? 

If he dropped him and I later got him would this appear to be collusion?

If he dropped him and I used my commissioner controls to make him an FA (which would be the situation if he hadn‚Äôt picked him up) would that be proper use of commissioner access. Would it then seem odd to then pick him up for myself who‚Äôs playing for the trophy?

Should he drop him and I put in a waiver for him and get him Friday? Is that fair to me if I should have already had access to him? 

I could always take him off his roster and return the guy he dropped to get him. But that‚Äôs a more invasive commissioner intervention than switching a dropped player to FA 

I‚Äôm looking for a way for a commissioner action to be fair and reasonable. 

Thanks!",fantasyfootball,1,1608744328,kix79e,1

4,Carolina DST Hail Mary,CamoFaSho,"Are you in the ship?

Have you been streaming DST all year and found yourself in a bit of a pickle here at the end?

Is this a hot take straight out of your local Shoney's dumpster?

MAYBE, but hear me out...

Carolina is rightfully un-rostered in 81% of Yahoo leagues right now, but look who they are going against this week. ***THE*** Washington Football Team. 

If Haskins is dealt a 4 game suspension for his Covid antics, and Alex Smith still isn't healthy, that would leave Taylor Heinicke left to start for The Football Team. A guy who last played in 2018 and threw 3 interceptions while hucking the ball 53 times. 

Then there is their RB situation. If Gibson remains out due to his toe injury, that leaves J.D. McKissic leading the backfield with Barber in the wing. McKissic has been a mediocre rusher, only eclipsing 50 yards twice this year with Gibson missing time, so his main threat will be in the passing game.

If you watch Heinicke highlights though, the man does NOT check down or dump off. Even on designed screens to McCaffrey, Heinicke would still tuck and run with a little pressure. He either hucks it chucks it football, or uses his legs. I wouldn't expect McKissic to have another 10 receptions with Heinicke under center, which pretty much nullifies him.

That is all, thanks. Good luck if you're in the ship!

7,V1per's Week 16 Survivor/Eliminator Pick,V1per41,"Great week last week. Ravens crushed Jacksonville while The Jets upset a very popular Rams pick. We have 2 weeks standing between us and a perfect season now. Unfortunately this week is going to be a bit tighter than we would like.

**I don't care about stupid math stuff, just give me the team to pick**

Houston Texans. Though the Chicago Bears are also very reasonable. The current spreads for each game is -8 and -7.5. I would definitely keep an eye on these lines and just take whichever one is larger on Sunday.

Though the Texans lost last week they were tied against a very good Colts team late in the game. On the flip side, Cincinnati did just upset Pittsburgh, though they also got blown out by the Cowboys just a week earlier.

I definitely do not feel super comfortable this week, but it's what we have left to work with.

**Nerdy Math Stuff**

P(Win Out) = 68.6% (+7.5pp)

E(Wins) = 16.66 (+0.11)

&amp;#x200B;

**Methodology**

I get team win percentages from 538 for every game in the entire season. I update probabilities for the current week based on Vegas betting lines to better take into account current team situations that 538's computer models can't account for.

With all of these values, I run something called the Hungarian Algorithm which solves the best possible choices to maximize the total win percentage values. This makes sure to use each team when it's optimal to do so.

The method used for this maximizes your chance of making it through the whole season undefeated. This is ideal if you are in a very large (70+ person) league. If however, you are in a small league that is unlikely to have everyone make it to the end and the last person standing is the winner, than the above picks will be less than ideal. If you're in one of these smaller leagues, download the file below, enter your league size and get the team list specifically for your league.

Welcome to the end!  I hope you're still in it, and of course I hope this QB series has helped make enough good choices, to outweigh the inevitable poorer recommendations.  Personally, I'm overall pleased with how this model has functioned over the season, excluding the first 3 weeks.  

[Week 15 Accuracy Round-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/subvertadown/comments/ki6ymu/subvertadown_week_15_accuracy_roundup/)  My accuracy returned to #1 for the week, and makes the model #1 for the last running 12 weeks.  

# QB chart ordered by Week 16

I know the model has Ryan/Goff/Stafford low, and Brady / Dalton / Tagovailoa high.  And I expect a lot of people will be trying to assess how trustworthy Hurts will be.  Fingers crossed!

To save a bit of time - after a long read, you get to a conclusion - per the study:  ""Though it did not reach statistical significance, offensive players affected by turf toe did show a trend toward lower performance after injury compared with controls.""

Now, with that said, plus the fact that McKissic continues to perform, is it possible, or even likely that Gibson, should he play, may be limited both in terms of touches and performance. And in that limitation be of little value to a championship roster.

My question is - do people still feel he would be a must play?

Those are his best.  I have To decide Tua or Trubisky, Higgins.  I‚Äôm starting Jacobs Ekeler Diggs Kelce Hilton probably which look strong but looking for an edge.  I have Conner Lockett and Coutee but probably drop them.  Mariota Minshew Stafford and Brees are available qbs on waiver wire and Leveon Bell on the wire too.  I have rolled out 7 different QBs this year.  üòÜ Thinking I should go with Tua and Leveon Bell.   Don‚Äôt know why espn rated Tua Tagovaloa below Trubisky.  Seems like Tua has more upside.  Anything else I can do to mitigate his Mahomes THill Monty juggernaut?  Oh, we play 14 team standard with just 5 bench spots.  1 week final.

83,Noah Fant,EmpyreanRose,"Week 16:  team high targets going for 8 out of 11

Week 15: Had to leave game with an illness. Replacement two tight ends for 9 targets

Week 14: team high targets going for 4 out of 7

Noah Fant is trending up, has a positive match up, but most importantly looks to be the most targeted receiver on the Broncos offense. Do you believe in starting Fant again against the Chargers which arguably another shoot out?

I seriously think he performs as the TE2 for week 16. My logic is that if he is getting TEAM HIGH targets in the last few games combined with a positive match up AND playing from behind, it will lead to high volume (8+ targets) and potential red zone opportunities (only competing with Patrick if we are being honest).",fantasyfootball,1,1608704939,kinvk9,1

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

Minimize: His role, coach's confidence in him by putting forth poor effort.  
Splash: His most used move during games. He doesn't do anything.  
Toxic: His influence on the team.  
Self-Destruct: His livelihood, career, prospects because of antics at prep, off-field or otherwise.  
Substitute: He is benched for another QB.   
Rest: He slumbers and will wake up to attack once again in one month, maybe two months, maybe three..  
Bide: He waits for his moment to reemerge and retake the starting spot.  
Growth: He probably learned something from the bench about how to be a leader. Or Maybe not.  
Recover: The moment has come, he has regained the starting spot for a game because someone got hurt. Nothing could make him happier.  
Harden, Horn Attack: Partying in a strip club with no mask, celebrating his newfound respect for his starting role, coaches, and women.

People in the league were texting me fed up that he made it that far and were about to call him out and I said no, I'll say something. I carefully explained that I'd let the game go on but if he wins everyone would get their money back, and if he lost the winner would obviously get the whole pool. He answered with, ""well if I don't get the winnings then I'm definitely not paying"". A few back and forths, and he sends everyone a screenshot of him paying me about 10 minutes ago. I then said ""thanks, that should've happened two months ago but the rules stated still stands"".

As always, I appreciate all feedback!

**Original Post for Reference:**

So what is this thing? I basically wanted to solve the mystery of ‚Äúseason average fantasy points per game‚Äù. With injuries and byes, you can never get a good look at the best fantasy players by total points, so I‚Äôm sure we all go and look at season average fantasy points per game to see who the best free agents are or to help decide sit/starts.

However I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve realized, there is an inherent problem when you do this. I've always mentally called it ‚ÄúDesean Jackson Syndrome‚Äù. You‚Äôve got two players you are comparing and they both are averaging 10 points a game through the first 3 weeks. However one of the guys scored 9, 10, &amp; 11 and the other guy scored 1, 25, &amp; 4 (Desean Jackson). The only way to know that this occurred is to click on each guy and look at the game logs, which is very annoying and time consuming.

Using pro-football-reference.com I was able to query the results of each player for each week and compile it all into one workbook. To make things simple and to match most of my leagues, I brought in fantasy points scored each week in a half-point PPR format. I then compared the points scored each week to the average in order to determine statistical dispersion, which basically is how far away do players stray from their average.

What you will find in the shared Google Drive PDF is the ability to determine the difference between consistent players or those that are boom-or-bust. You always hear, ‚Äúthat guy is reliable, he has a high floor‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust him, he‚Äôs boom-or-bust‚Äù, well now you can visually see those characteristics in the data.

Few things to keep in mind when you look at this:

* Fantasy points are shown with half-point PPR
* Anyone who hasn‚Äôt played in at least 50% of the weeks over any given period are filtered out
* Anyone who is averaging &lt;5 fantasy points are filtered out
* This is simply a guide to help you analyze past performance of players and it does not provide game context or predict future performance

 I can't believe we're here at the end! Thanks for following me, and I hope you enjoyed a season which many thought wouldn't even make it this far.  I have been excited and surprised at how well the D/ST model performed overall.  I suspected it should be among the best when I finished the new developments in the spring.  But actually hanging out at #1 was something of a surprise.  I look forward to next season, which will use my ""Tiebreaker model"" that previewed on Patreon this year.  It overperformed, and I think it's the way of the future.

I can't believe we're here at the end!  Thanks for following me, and I hope you enjoyed a season which many thought wouldn't even make it this far.  I am excited overall at how the new Kicker model has contributed.  I see ways to improve and will bring them to you next year.  I also just discovered a (hopefully minor) bug in my inputs processing, which affected the last couple months-- therefore you will soon see me reporting about what the accuracy should have been.

Lutz was a bust for all sources.  Other sources produced a bust in Sanders; for me it would have been Parkey among my top 10.  But overall it was a more decent week than other recent weeks for Kicker.

**Quick checklist,** to help empower you with more responsibility in your kicker selection, and to embolden your gut feel if it goes against rankings:

1. If a kicker is low, do you expect their team to actually win, even when betting lines predict a loss? Then go for it even if the rankings say not to.
2. If a kicker is high, do you instead expect their team to lose, even when predicted to win? Then stay away even if the rankings suggest choosing him.
3. Can you foresee a scenario where the kicker's own defense lets the opponent build up a large early lead? Then stay away even if highly ranked.
4. Will the opposing QB underperform relative to expectations? Go for it.
5. Does the opposing defense usually give up more than 27 points? Risky.

Remember, every single week game scripts go against expectations, so you have a chance to apply some judgement if you think you can.  As always, go with a selection that you'll feel the least regret picking when he busts.

2,Please help me solve a league dispute involving who ends up in the championship matchup,delli,"Hey everyone,

So in one of the semifinals in our 12 man ESPN PPR league, there was a tie: 136-136. We don't play with decimals (although we might change that for next year), and historically in the regular season we've settled ties by taking the bench with the highest number of points. 

In this semifinal matchup, Team A had more bench points than Team B, and our whole league was texting about how Diontae Johnson was 1 yard away from handing Team B the win, but unfortunately Team B lost on bench points. Everyone went to sleep knowing Team A was in the finals and Team B was in the consolation game.

This morning, our league sees that ESPN has put Team B in the finals rather than Team A because of a rule no one, not even our commissioner, knew about, which is that in the event of a tie in the playoffs, the team with the higher seed (Team B) will advance. Now some conflict has come up with who gets to advance, and I'd like to get your opinions on what the right decision is.

Does Team A win on bench points like the whole league expected? Does Team B win on an ESPN rule that we didn't know about?

What do we do?

Thanks for your input in advance.",fantasyfootball,1,1608667058,kicqq6,1

# It's been a fucking good season ladies and gentlemen. Good luck to those still in it and have a healthy holiday weekend + new years + 2021!

Weekly, I'll be posting these types of posts alongside my [RBBC Trends]() post

Notes:

- Purpose: Find out who's getting rushes/targets inside the 20 and is more likely to score

- A Redzone look is a target or rushing attempt within the opponents 20 yard line.

25,How are we feeling about Josh Allen this week?,MikeAr198,"Allen is coming off an incredible game that carried me and I‚Äôm sure several others to a fantasy super bowl. 

However, Denver was severely deleted on defense and especially at the corner position which primed him for a smash spot. 

This week he plays New England on Monday night. Last time these teams met, Allen had his worst fantasy performance of the season.

30,"Week 16 - Average Points Allowed, Last 3 Weeks",joeyhustle,"You've been working all season to get to this moment. You've worked the waivers, you've made the trades, you've rosterbated until your hand is raw, and somehow, you've tinkered with your lineup even more. But none of that matters... you're here. Now let's do the damn thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Because things change so drastically on a week to week basis in the NFL, I wanted to see how the matchups looked using a three week window. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on feedback from last season, I am now looking an extra week back for teams that have had a BYE week in the last 3 weeks (CAR, TB).

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's the results for Week 16:**

|Scoring Rules|URL|
|:-|:-|
|Standard|[https://i.imgur.com/425mlK8.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/425mlK8.jpeg)|

|PPR|[https://i.imgur.com/snTwaqw.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/snTwaqw.jpeg)|

&amp;#x200B;

**How to read the chart:** This data is showing the amount of points allowed, so if you‚Äôre looking at QBs, the Philadelphia Eagles are allowing a lot of PPG in the last 3 weeks (good matchup for Andy Dalton) while the Seattle Seahawks are not (bad matchup for Jared Goff).

Green = good matchup, Yellow = average matchup, Red = bad matchup.

The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.

The teams in the Prev 3 Opponents column are the teams that the team on the left has played in the last 3 weeks.

The team in the Opponent column is who plays the team on the left this week.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, some have asked for the ability to sort by position, so [here's a link to the data in a Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f1J3CL8Ea3CCBpFcxvup1m4SOBgdgnKOTu34wyyZi28/edit?usp=sharing).

So I have deandre swift, jk dobbins, gaskin and sanders. I definitely am starting Sanders but having some trouble deciding on who to fill my rb2 and flex roles with. 

Swift has a brutal matchup but I‚Äôm leaning towards starting him. Dobbins has a tough matchup and might be due for a dud game and I‚Äôm worried about gaskin splitting carries with Ahmed. Any advice on who youd roll out this week?",fantasyfootball,1,1608662319,kib7mg,1

Players to drop:

1. Handcuffs (yours and others) of healthy players
2. Any RB, WR or TE that you don't plan on starting AND that is not good enough to crack your opponent's lineup (doesn't matter if they're good enough to crack someone else's lineup - not your issue). Especially true if you were carrying 5+ RBs or WRs (or a backup TE) because you didn't have any studs - pick your starting lineup and dump the rest.

Players to pick up even if you don't need them:

1. Hurts, Tannehill and maybe even Tua if your opponent has a shitty QB (because they've been streaming) or a QB that has been doing shitty lately (e.g., Wilson). 
2. Browns and Chiefs DST (but potentially even WFT or Miami) if your opponent has a shitty DST (because they've been streaming) or a DST that has been doing shitty lately (e.g., Steelers).",fantasyfootball,1,1608660887,kiar1c,1

**Waiver Wires are where leagues are won**

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

I know the rationale answer is, ‚ÄúJust play whoever has the best matchups/are projected highest‚Äù or ‚ÄúJust use u/subvertatown rankings‚Äù (which is what helped me get to the ship in the first place and what I‚Äôll probably still use to help decide since his rankings are the best), but I don‚Äôt want to leave any stone unturned in my matchup and as much as I loathe kickers with a passion, I have to consider the fact that, when playing in the last game of the season and trying to win it all, I have to shoot for the ceiling and I‚Äôm concerned that playing QB and K from same team limits that ceiling.

So what are your thoughts on stacking QB and K from the same team for a specific ‚Äúmust win/championship‚Äù scenario as opposed to season long? Does the increase in floor production make up for the lowered ceiling or is it something that should be avoided if in need of a higher potential output?

89,Yahoo Waivers in a Keeper Leage,HaverTime9,"So i'm officially out of the championship after losing by less than a point in the semi's.  So it's time to look ahead to next year!  I currently roster 3 QBs (Murray, Herbert, and Hurts).

We have 3 bench spots and we are allowed 2 Keepers, this is why rostering 3 QBs is hurting my outlook.  The Keeper counts as the round higher than the player was picked.  A waiver pick up counts as your last round and 2nd last round if you keep 2 waiver picks.  Can't keep players picked in the first 3 rounds.  My potential keepers are as follows: Murray - Would count as my 4th.  Boyd - Would count as my 5th. Monty - My 6th.  I also could keep Herbert or Hurts for my 13th pick.  I think the value of keeping one of those as my 13th outweighs Murray at 4.

My question though is this.  Our league ends after week 16.  Is there a waiver period after this?  My plan was to drop Murray on Friday so he couldn't be picked up by either team in the finals.  Hold onto Hurts and Herbert until i make my keeper decision. And then load the rest of my roster with potential keepers for next year.

93,Logan Thomas in Week 16,PancherosFood,"As many of us head towards what is the final week in most leagues, everyone in the chip is looking for that game winning lineup to power their victory. Many people in the chip most likely have Waller, Kelce, Tonyan, or Henry... and we all know TE has been pretty much the biggest wasteland seen in years. 

Why is Logan Thomas a talking point you may ask?

If you watch the WFT play, whether Dwayne Haskins or Alex Smith is at the helm there is a ton of check downs. This is a literal PPR goldmine, and even if you have Kelce, Waller, or another top TE then you seriously might want to look into FLEXing Logan Thomas.

I know the thought of FLEXing a TE is outlandish, especially in a time like this and chip szn.

Why is he a good play this week?

- Last 3 weeks, he combines for 28 catches, 242 yards, and a TD. If you are in a deeper league and not a 6 person league, these are some great numbers. 

- The matchup is amazing. The panthers D is abysmal at giving up catches to TEs. If the prophecy holds true and he continues to consume targets like this, he will most likely have a great day even if he doesn‚Äôt touch pay dirt.

* **QB - Marcus Mariota - LV - 1% - 26.84**

* **FLEX - Chad Hansen - WR - HOU - 2% - 12.5**
* **D/ST - New York Jets - 5% - 8**
* **K - Cairo Santos - CHI - 1% - 18**

This team is available in 83.24% of leagues and would've scored 135.34 points.

How many of your leagues would this team be moving on to the championship? 

Mariota came in as a backup and played pretty well. I wouldn't look his way next week against the Dolphins.

The Lions are so bad against running backs that backups do well too. On only 20% of snaps he caught 1 for a TD. Evans is a decent RB who is going to be buried behind Derrick Henry.

Rodney Smith didn't do much but not many unowned RBs did this week. He turned 7 touches into 6.2 points, also playing against a pretty bad run D, though the Packers have modestly improved the last couple weeks. Still expect Derrick Henry to run through the Packers next week, and Evans may even match his production against the Lions, though that will be less assured.

Pascal came back in a big way. He took the powers of TY Houston for this week and caught 5 of 6 targets for 79 yds and 2 TDs. 

Greg Ward reappeared. Like Pascal he posted 2 TDs this week, on fewer targets and fewer snaps. The Colts and Eagles WRs are really hard to predict this year, but each week at least one seems to do well. 

We all knew a Minnesota TE would do well this week, we just all thought it would be Irv Smith. It was Conklin however who got a TD which is usually all a TE needs to do to make it onto the best unowned team. 

Chad Hansen was talked up as a possible flex play and he delivered. His score was helped by a long TD but he could be in play as long as Cobb is out. Watson can support multiple pass catchers. Cooks and Coutee are his top options right now, Coutee has disappointed in the past so there is room for someone else to emerge. 

The Jets beat the Rams. The Bengals beat the Steelers. Why do we even try to predict this silly game? The Jets came to play against a top team, and probably lost the number 1 overall pick because of it. I'm still planning to play the Bowns D against them next week in my championship matchup but I am a little more nervous about it than I was. 

Santos is a good kicker and surprisingly the Bears offense has looked better with Trubisky at the helm. He could be a good option against JAX next week.

I‚Äôve made basically every single roster decision on the year (picking up James Robinson, picked up hurts before the playoffs, set every lineup, etc.) My BIL now claims he split the buy in with his brother, and they each thought the other was running the team.

12,Re post now that I have been proven right: Brandon Aiyuk is comparable to just jefferson. If they were in opposite systems aiyuk would be doing just as well if not better than JJ.,byebyebrain,"I wrote this 2 weeks ago and i got so much crap. People saying i was a moron, idiot, just plain stupid. Its tough being right before the lemmings actually understand the logic behind stuff. Now everyone is moaning about how Aiyuk might be the best Wr in his class.   
Brandon Aiyuk has scored more fantasy points per game (20.8) than every WR in the league since Week 7 except for: Tyreek Hill (27.5) and Davante Adams (26.6). ‚Äî Also: Aiyuk's last 6 games: \*45 catches \*568 yards \*4 TDs Set the #49ers rookie reception record (57) and has 2 more games to go.‚Äù Aiyuk has had either 100 yards receiving or a TD in every game during that stretch. ‚Äî And if all of that doesn‚Äôt get you excited enough, here‚Äôs Kyle Shanahan on Brandon Aiyuk ""Aiyuk has not arrived yet. He can get a lot better. A lot.""  
Maybe this is why I am in the championship for the 5th time in my 7 years in my dynasty auction league and a lot of you haven't ever sniffed the playoffs.   
And for those of you who say ""well JJ made the pro bowl and Aiyuk didn't"" yeah..Jrob didn't make the pro bowl either and he is 4th in the league in scrimmage yards. Pro Bowl is about marketing to sell a tv show.   
   When someone makes a post like i did, maybe not use the inflammatory words like ""stupid, dumb, moron, or idiotic"".   
Just because you aren't smart enough to understand the logic doesn't mean its incorrect. The sub would be much better and would help more people if there would be less insulting posts and more rebuttals using logic and facts.   
To those of you who aren't in your ship like i am....maybe listen more and insult less.",fantasyfootball,1,1608648546,ki6pnw,1
13,If he returns: G. Kittle or L. Thomas?,PapaSyntax,"Ahoy ahoy, team managers, 

I've made it to the big game and have kept Kittle on my IR spot since he went out (along with McCaffrey and Gaskin...ouch). If Kittle does return this week and is considered a healthy play, given the success that Thomas has had with the WAS offense lately, I'm considering continuing to play Thomas. That's the more favorable matchup as well given opponents.

22,Week 15: Top Scoring Lineup - Semi-Finals,plastictaxicab,"Who's going to the 'ship?!

\---------------------------------

Here is your Week 15 top scoring lineup (standard scoring):

**QB Jalen Hurts 37.82**

**WR Calvin Ridley 22.30**

**WR Deandre Hopkins 21.00**

**RB David Montgomery 28.20**

**RB Tony Pollard 25.20**

**TE Darren Waller 21.00**

**FLEX Derrick Henry 23.20**

**K Cairo Santos 18.00**

**DST Dallas 15.00**

\---------------------------------

This lineup would've given you 211.72 points. Fairly low-scoring week for being the semis. Did you get lucky as a Zeke owner and finally get good game from his handcuff? Are you willing to risk starting Jalen Hurts in the championship? Stranger things have happened this year. Good luck to everyone who made it to the big game!

26,"With Pittsburgh losing last night, the Chiefs are now guaranteed the #1 seed in the AFC. Is there a legitimate risk of the Chiefs sitting Tyreek/Kelce/Mahomes against the Falcons in week 16?",StarOfAthenry,"With the Steelers going down the to Bengals, the Chiefs have locked in the #1 playoff seed in the AFC. Next Sunday, the Chiefs are set to play the Atlanta Falcons in the final game of the regular season. Aside from the opportunity for individual players to set records, this game is otherwise meaningless. 

This brings up a serious issue for fantasy team managers playing in the championship this weekend. Will Andy Reid decide to sit his all-star players (Tyreek/Kelce/Mahomes) to shield them from injury? After watching CEH go down in the game against the Saints, managers have to wonder if the Chiefs will be extra cautious about exposing other star players to injury risk.

31,"Matt Ruhle‚Äôs dishonest injury reporting...see rant below, but taking a look back at CMAC‚Äôs season vs the updates was flat out playing games with the injury report.",Jlmoe4,"At what point does the Coach get  fined for lying all season. None of this was covid-related where maybe the league is more understanding. 
This isn‚Äôt the case here. Sorry but cmac wasn‚Äôt questionable for weeks at a time before being ruled out weekly.

Coach knew damn well  he wasn‚Äôt playing but every Friday, he‚Äôd magically go from questionable to out as if they just figured that out.... Matt Ruhle cant play smart and play dumb at the same time. Life doesn?t work that way...
So Belichick can get fined for doing this exact same thing multiple times( not a pats fan) , so should matt ruhle. 

The NFL needs to take a hard look at this...he thinks he‚Äôs still at Baylor pulling college football #$%$ but in the NFL, u can‚Äôt t say your starter may be back for 13 games while claiming he‚Äôs questionable. Doubtful at best would have been closer to honest as we now know. 
Most obvious educated guess is so other team has to game plan for cmac-dude if u can‚Äôt win any other way than maybe the NFL isn‚Äôt for you). 

Last point is there‚Äôs no way Vegas wasn‚Äôt impacted from a betting standpoint.. cmac playing vs not playing will 100% affect the line that game (that‚Äôs exactly the info gamblers seek to get an edge obviously). 

Rant over but as someone who dropped numerous players who ended up being good but I had to make my lineup ‚Äúlegal‚Äù forcing me to drop players just to be able to move cmac from IR to bench (so he can be questionable for 2 days -it sounds dumber and more obvious coaching #$%$kery every time I say it). I‚Äôm sure those of you who dropped Mike Davis after one of the he‚Äôs def back Sunday were thrilled also.

I end up watching the rest of the game, praying that this man doesn‚Äôt throw another INT. After the late dropped pick by Jackson almost gave me a heart attack, I‚Äôm now winning by .08. At this point, I think I escape with the narrow dub, but fate had other plans. The Bengals end up kicking the FG and giving the ball back for one more play.

This thread is for people to post about who they are targeting on the waiver wire, ask others if it‚Äôs worth burning their waiver for a player, discuss what they are bidding for someone if they use FAAB, and because waivers clear overnight and the next day's theme thread is not posted until the next morning - you should also use this thread to talk about who you managed to get or just missed out on once your waivers process. 

If you're posting specifics and looking for feedback please be sure to post what waiver you're using, league size, and how your waivers work (weekly reset, weekly inverse standing, rolling list, etc) For people in FAAB leagues, please post how much you're bidding on the player and remember that you should post the bid amount as a *percentage* of your initial budget OR post both the bid amount and the initial budget so everyone can see the percentage you're spending. Telling us you're bidding $73 on someone doesn't help much if your FAAB budget is $1000 and everyone else is playing with a $200 budget.

At 5:27 in the third quarter (5:15 in the video), Ryan Finley tucks the ball and charges headfirst into the defense in what looks like a QB run play before being tackled at the line of scrimmage. This was credited as a sack to Tuitt on Pittsburgh. To be considered a sack, the passer must be intending to throw a forward pass. Should this be a sack? If not, does the NFL reliably correct plays like this?

But this week I can bench him without any qualms and it‚Äôs makes me feel bad at how relieved I am 

Idk it just seems like sometimes fantasy football and I guess sports (and betting since were mostly all in $$$ leagues) makes me feel mixed emotions because of the real lives at stake

78,Losers of Fantasy Football - what did you learn this year that you will incorporate in next year's draft?,BigBet0,"- I am no matter what getting a STUD Tight End (Waller or Kelce... MAYBE Kittle). The weeks constantly trying to find a FA option and having them score like 2.7 points is over. Was a constant issue the entire season. 

- The WR's I drafted I played the entire season. There is the theory.. WR is deep, but I made it to the semi finals and the entire time my WR's constantly performed and other than a bye week ro two the entire season played them for much success. 

- RB is crapshoot. Didnt' get enough depth this year on them, plan to next year make my entire bench RB's and one backup WR (assuming I have 2 starting WR's and dont even consider making the FLEX an RB or TE)

- Koo is a legend. The most consistent and productive player on my team by far was Koo who saved me and got me a win I'd argue in at least 4 or 5 games this year. I'd go up to $5 for him next year especially with that anemic Falcons offense.

- QB is deep. I would lean towards taking a running QB no matter what next year so worse case even if your RB""s don't play well, you can make up for it with a QB. Kyler, Hurts, etc",fantasyfootball,1,1608624376,ki14as,1

83,Hypothetical Collusion Situation Bad Enough To Quit A League? Or is this normal?,keepchuckin,"Total hypothetical, this is not my personal situation nor a personal post, moreso a jumping off point to define what is considered acceptable behavior in the Fantasy Football community. It's a bit extreme but completely possible:

Let's say you are the new 12th team in a 12 man team. You don't really know the other 11 as well as they know each other, they all work together and hang out. You're a bit of an outsider relative to the league. They've all been playing together for 10 years and you're brand new, filling in for someone else who mysteriously quit last year. Winner of the league gets 2,000 bucks, so it's high stakes and pretty competitive.

Lets say you somehow make the finals much to the chagrin of the rest of the leaguemates, and you need to pick up a player. During the course of the season you could sense an envious tone to their emails as you put up the most cumulative points and started to scare some of them that a new guy could come in and immediately win the pot they've been trying to win for 10+ years.

During the finals week, one of the long and forgotten eliminated teams (the best friend of the guy you're going against in the finals) picks up or makes a claim on a critical player that you also made a claim on. The eliminated friend gets the player, but they don't even have a matchup for the rest of the season. 

 

You, still playing for 2,000 dollars, get a different player who doesn't do as well, and you end up narrowly losing by less than 2 points. 

 

One could quickly draw the conclusion that the eliminated friends team maliciously intended to pick up a player they didn't need only to help a friend, and sabotage a new leaguemate.

Is this fraud? Or is this traditionally how fantasy football works? 

If it's not traditional, or somewhat shady, would you advise I quit this league?",fantasyfootball,1,1608619632,ki03av,1

91,Ryan Finley and The Tik Tok Star Game,bigboybarrybus,"What a finish for Week 15. The Bengals expose the Steelers in dominant fashion. I just wanted to make a write up on what I saw in this game for those who missed it.

THE STEELERS NEED A RUN GAME. 
-Benny Snell had his fair share, but only because the Bengals weren‚Äôt going to let Big Ben beat them through the air. The play-calling for run design plays aren‚Äôt executed well as Snell would get hit on the line or behind it. Fantasy wise, Snell is an RB2 if Connor is out. He showed good vision on outside runs but what holds him back is play-calling and the o line. 

BIG BEN BUSTS 
- Big Ben was horrible today, typical road ben. He missed throws, missed a possible TD to Claypool on a Post route but threw it to Ebron in triple coverage which led him to get injured. Bad reads and forcing balls in tight windows was what killed him. Big Ben is a QB2 for his next matchup against the Colts, be weary about starting him. 

BENGALS DEFENSE SHOWED UP
- This is by far the best showing by the Bengals defense this season. Corners were flying around swatting balls out of receivers hands, D-line was getting pressure on Big Ben, and linebackers were giving big hits to Tik Tok stars. Juju Smith Shoester must‚Äôve lit a fire on that defense as he danced around on the logo. Really impressed by that defense, could be one to look at for next year. They have a really great secondary but there‚Äôs better options for fantasy defenses right now. 

RYAN FINLEY IS A WARRIOR
- Dare I say, Zac Taylor called a great game with his playcalling with Ryan Finley. RPO style. Bernard produces on the ground and Finley manages a great game with his running ability and vision on the RPOs. 
Finleys big run for a TD was shades of Kyler Murray, just slower. His runs on the RPOs took some big hits which kind of reminded me of Dak‚Äôs warrior ability when bracing for big hits when taking the option. Finley played the game manager role perfectly as he leads the Bengals to a big morale win. Bernard is an RB2 for his next matchup against the horrid Texans defense. And for Finley, don‚Äôt start him next week unless you have too. 


I know this was a crazy unpredictable game, so I know there was major fantasy implications. Did this game keep your season alive or ruin your season? 


TLDR: BENGALS SHOWED UP, STEELERS EXPOSED.
Steelers no run game and bad Big Ben lost them the game. Bengals lights out defense and game manager Finley with his sidekick Bernard to help Bengals win.",fantasyfootball,1,1608616315,khzbgr,1
92,Worst player to add to get them a ring?,SilversunThunder,"Every time I make the championship game, which doesn‚Äôt happen a lot, I try to use one bench spot on a terrible player to possibly give them a shot at a ring. Last time was like 4 year ago and I got Landry Jones a ring.

We've all undoubtedly had a helluva year. People have lost jobs,  family members,  friends,  lost time being separated with family,  and other painful experiences.

Over these past 4 months of ff I've had a fantastic time being apart of this community. You guys crack me up, have great takes, hot takes,  and are overall a terrific group to be with. 

Wanted you all to know I have nothing but love for you guys and wouldn't have it any other way. 

Thank you all for everything.  Wishing you and your family a loving and fantastic rest of your year.

Since Kenny Golladay and TJ Hockenson are targeted the most, it‚Äôs inconclusive to say anything about Marvin Jones, until this year.

My point of all this is I think Matthew Stafford should be in the Pro Bowl this year, not Russel Wilson. No disrespect to Russ, but he‚Äôs been on a downhill trend that looks to continue if the Rams‚Äô D manages to straighten themselves out.",fantasyfootball,1,1608607222,khwydq,1

&amp;nbsp;

Welcome to Statistically (in)Significant, the place to find great stats that probably only matter at the water cooler (or bar). Each week I'll dig through the stats of the week gone by and deliver you some choice conversation starters. All fantasy stats are half PPR scoring unless otherwise noted.

 &amp;nbsp;

**37+ Fantasy Points**

 &amp;nbsp;

A trio of quarterbacks leads the NFL in fantasy points for week 15. At the top of the group is Eagles rookie **Jalen Hurts**, who had his first start last week after seeing a handful of snaps in almost every game this season. Hurts‚Äô debut was not bad, he had over 100 yards passing and the Eagles upset the Saints, but this week showed that he‚Äôs a legit QB. Hurts threw for 338 yards with 3 TDs, adding 63 yards and another TD on the ground for a total of 37.82 fantasy points. Zero turnovers, despite the loss, is probably the most important stat to the coach, and it‚Äôs clear that this job is about to be his to lose, and Wentz might be looking for a new home next year. Meanwhile, **Josh Allen** and **Ryan Tannehill** both eclipsed 37 fantasy points while leading their teams to 48 and 46 points respectively. Between them, they threw for 632 yards, 5 TDs, and ran for 4 touchdowns ‚Äì two apiece. Both Tannehill and Allen are probably on lots of teams that are going to the finals, but if you managed to start Hurts and are going to the finals, well, just exactly how do you get around with those giant brass balls of yours?

 &amp;nbsp;

**1106 Days**

 &amp;nbsp;

There were three wide receivers of note that scored their first touchdown in a year or more on Sunday, but none of them had a gap like **Dez Bryant**, who scored for the Ravens. It was his first touchdown in 1,106 days, more than 3 years ago on December 10th, 2017 ‚Äì which was a 50-yard strike from **Dak Prescott**. Bryant was joined by fellow veteran WRs **Antonio Brown** (462 days) and **Larry Fitzgerald** (364 days ‚Äì ok ok not technically a year). Both of whom caught touchdowns last year and today from the same QB, though Brown (and Brady) have the distinction of both moving to a new team. Honorable mentions go to **Jake Kumerow** (426 days) and **Marcus Mariota** ‚Äì 445 days since his last passing TD and 772 days since his last rushing score. While we‚Äôre at it, might as well congratulate those who have never scored before - **Lil‚ÄôJordan Humphrey** (NO), **Quez Watkins** (PHI), **Darrynton Evans** (TEN), and **Jalen Hurts** (PHI) getting his first rushing TD, the only way the bookies count a real TD scored.

 &amp;nbsp;

**1,679 Rushing Yards**

 &amp;nbsp;

**Derrick Henry**, or El Tractorcito if you‚Äôll help me propagate his fantastic nickname a little bit, is absolutely crushing everyone in rushing yards this year. He‚Äôs averaging 120 yards per game (ok, 119.9, but this is about gushing here‚Ä¶) and only needs to average a bit over 160 yards the last 2 games in order to reach the fabled 2,000-yard season. Through 14 games this year, he‚Äôs already passed his total from last year where he led the league with 1,540 yards in 15 games. Henry has nearly doubled up the 10th highest rushing total on the year, **Jonathan Taylor‚Äôs** 842 yards. Henry‚Äôs only real competition at this point is **Dalvin Cook**, with 1,484 rushing yards. Cook actually leads the league in yards from scrimmage with 1,833, on pace for 2,256 total yards on the season. Cook has now cracked 300 points on the season, Henry is third with 278 and there‚Äôs a huge gap between him and 4th place. Both Cook and Henry have gone over 300 touches for two years in a row, so be careful drafting next year

 &amp;nbsp;

**27 Passing Touchdowns**

 &amp;nbsp;

**Justin Herbert** tied the rookie passing touchdowns record this past Thursday, adding two more to his season total and tying **Baker Mayfield‚Äôs** record of 27 he set in 2018, and hasn‚Äôt yet matched in his career. Herbert still has two games left in the season in order to assume the mantle all on his own, though it should be noted that Mayfield started only 13 games in 2018, matching Herbert‚Äôs total so far this year. Herbert‚Äôs OT win over the Raiders probably put him back firmly in the lead for offensive rookie of the year, especially with the one-yard rushing touchdown to seal the game at the end of overtime, and despite Anthony Lynn‚Äôs apparent attempts to get his quarterback killed. Herbert is truly putting together an impressive rookie year, especially when one takes into account that the plan was not for him to start much, if at all this year. He has a 27:10 TD to INT ratio, something that QBs like **Kyler Murray**, **Jared Goff**, and **Matt Ryan** cannot boast. His 4 rushing TDs is also something that Mayfield could not match in his rookie year ‚Äì he did not find the end zone on his own until his second season.

 &amp;nbsp;

**88 Total Rushing Yards**

 &amp;nbsp;

Who says you need a running game to be balanced or have success in this league? On Sunday, the Buccaneers and Falcons combined for a whopping 88 rushing yards between the two teams. **Leonard Fournette** led the way with a blistering 49 yards (and 2 scores, giving him a new fantasy day in the end), and 3 players wound up with negative rushing totals on the game, keeping us below 90. **Brian Hill** really helped that along, with 5 attempts for -2 yards. He added 2 catches for 9 yards, meaning he averaged exactly 1 yard per touch on the day. So, what did this lack of a rushing attack mean for the game as a whole? Well, the game blew the Vegas total out of the water, with 58 total points ‚Äì under bettors were counting their winnings after a whopping 17 points in the first half. 22 teams passed the 88-yard mark and 5 players did it all on their own. In fact, those 5 all went over 120 rushing yards, leaving this game in the dust.

24,Thoughts on Eagles D/ST (@ Dallas) in Week 16 ?,whoosh2112,"I know the Cowboys just torched the Niners defense in Week 15, but let's be real this Niners D has been bad for most of the season. 

Now the Cowboys face the Eagles in Week 16. 

The Eagles are 2nd in the league in sacks,  and the Cowboys are 22nd in sacks allowed. So there is a good chance Dalton could face constant pressure from the Eagles. 

What are everyone's thoughts on the Eagles D this week ? Would you consider starting them if you don't have better options in the Championship ?",fantasyfootball,1,1608595996,khtsaz,1

48,Semi-final conundrum.,shame_les,"So unfortunately I've run into a problem I've never encountered before. 


In one of the leagues I commish we start 16 players, 8 Offensive, 7 Defensive, and 1 K. This week one of the semi-finalists started 9 Offensive players, and 6 Defensive guys instead. 


The problem wasn't noted until today when someone noticed and I verified. To make it worse (or better, I don't even know anymore) it's the first time they've done it looking at their lineup history. 


This year I've run into some weird things on MFL (like my waiver not running when they're supposed to, or people having their lineups locked for some reason after the 1pm games when they play later even though the settings were saying otherwise) but the reason his lineup was accepted is because a few weeks back 3 teams didn't start lineups for the week and after the 1pm games I changed the settings to allow them to at least submit a partial lineup even if incomplete, to at least not give some playoff teams easy wins while fighting for their spots. 


I also submitted a lineup for next week with the same 9/6 ratio, to see if it would be accepted, and a warning does tell you that the lineup is illegal. 


What are my options here? I honestly have no idea how to make this decision with so much on the line for everyone involved. I appreciate the help.",fantasyfootball,1,1608592823,khsujs,1

Yes, I should have prepared and picked up Benny as back up. Not only did he pick up Benny, he also picked up, Samuels, Williams, Perine and McFarland Jr.

51,Commissioner Question,AMZN2THEMOON,"With James Conner being ruled out, there were some teams out there starting James Conner in the RB slot without holding Snell. An opponent added all of the backup RBs for both sides and dropped his bench to block the Conner owner from having a running back. In the interest of fairness, would you allow this as commissioner?",fantasyfootball,1,1608592403,khsq08,1
52,Rams D/ST in Week 16?,EastCoastTaffy,"I‚Äôm surprised that I haven‚Äôt seen a single post about what was probably the biggest letdown of Week 15, the Rams D/ST performance against the Jets. This unit was supposed to be a week-winner, especially coming off the absolute dismantling of New England‚Äôs offense last week. They went from their best output of the season to arguably their worst, since their only lower score came way back in Week 3 when they traveled to a red-hot Buffalo offense. This unit failed to record a single turnover for the first time in over 2 months, against a putrid Jets offense which has turned the ball over at least once in every game for the last 2 months. Was this a case of the Rams thinking they could just roll out the helmets? How do you feel about a bounce-back in Week 16 @ Seattle? Is it a better move to pivot to a streamer with a better matchup? (Bears @ Jax / Chargers vs Den / Texans vs Cin) This is pretty much the only start/sit decision I have for my championship matchup, but I need some advice for it...",fantasyfootball,1,1608592400,khspz3,1

We just looked again and it seems like KC DST may have lost a point between the end of the Sunday night game and right now.

Personally I still see taking him in the top 8. Is that a bad choice?

Do teams that have nothing to play for have a precedent of benching their star players? E.g. will Dalvin Cook fresh off his new contract play a full game?

This year Josh is averaging 24.5 fantasy points and performing as a Top 5 QB. He has shown tremendous passing improvement while adding 8 rushing TDs and a receiving TD for good measure. His fantasy bomb dropping ability is noted as he owns 5 of the Top 50 QB performances this season, tied with Mahomes and Wilson, and second to Murray's 6.

In Week 16 he plays his second game of the year vs NE and his fifth overall (he missed one matchup in his rookie season due to injury). He posted his worst game of this season vs NE in Week 8. He has historically not performed well against them, posting lines of:

[New England has performed well against the QB position this year](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/stats/posvsdef/QB/NE/teambreakdown/standard), good for 3rd in the league with an average of 16.14 fantasy points allowed to opposing QBs.

Given this history - does Josh still fit the definition of ""start your studs"" or would you consider benching him for a match up play who may be on your wire like Baker Mayfield vs the Jets, [who are giving up 25.14 points per game to opposing QBs](https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/stats/posvsdef/QB/NYJ/teambreakdown/standard)?

16,A little prophesy of Tony Pollard's breakout,saturatethethermal,"https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/kftgfu/james_robinson_a_full_participant_at_practice/ggavk0k/

""I think it's because with Running Back it often has a lot to do with the offensive line, and gameplan, which can easily change.

Look at Zeke. Makes you wonder if he's really that much better than other RBs, or if it was just a great O-line, and the fact that he was given bellcow status.

I mean, look at Pollard. Dude can ball. Only reason he isn't fantasy viable is because he happens to be out of the game plan. **That kind of stuff can change very quickly.** He's arguably at the same level, or in some cases better than Zeke, or at least close to as good. But he simply doesn't get the carries... **for now.**

A completely fantasy irrelevant RB can become a top 4 guy if he was given the carries/gameplans of other top 5 RBs. James Robinson is the perfect example... dude wasn't even drafted, but was put in a good spot and given a lot of carries. I'm pretty sure Pollard could have put up Robinson's numbers with that many touches... there are probably dozens of RBs in the league who could have. There are a few RBs in the league who are actually elite skill players(like Saquon, Bell used to be in his prime, CMC, etc). But, a lot of the top RBs fantasy wise are just beneficiaries of good O-line, and good game plan, thus they're much more volitile than, say a top WR, who is less likely to get gameplanned out.

Look at Mark Ingram. Dude went from a mid/top Fantasy guy to nothing rather quickly.

Look at Kamara. Went from by far #1 fantasy RB to nothing almost instantly when the game plan changed. He's a talented guy... but being talented doesn't equate to fantasy success. Just like being not all that talented(Zeke, Jrob) doesn't necessarily mean you'll be bad in fantasy.

Zach Ertz is a great example. He's a decent TE. But he was awesome in fantasy simply because he got thrown the ball all the time. I don't think he was a top 2 or 3 TE skill wise(not even close). But fantasy wise he was.""",fantasyfootball,1,1608580133,khoooa,1

23,Is Jalen Hurts a QB1 next week against Dallas?,Mudgie101,"Speaking as a biased Eagles fan, he's looked completely electric in the last three games he's played in. Extending plays outside the pocket, making accurate throws downfield, and rushing for 50+ yards/game and multiple rushing touchdowns. 

For all the excitement that Josh Allen got for his huge Saturday game, Hurts scored even more points. He was actually close to cracking 40 points, as he put three touchdown throws into Dallas Goeddert's hands in the last few minutes (very, very tough contested catches, but still).

So this begs the question on his ranking going forward, with some players finals and semi finals coming up this week. Personally, I see him as an easy lock for a top ten QB, and I'm very inclined to play him over Josh Allen, who has a difficult road game vs New England looming",fantasyfootball,1,1608578697,kho6zq,1

Two key things, both of which come from here:

* **Beersheets**.  I learned about it here.  It's the second year rocking these in both leagues, and this year they were gamechangers.  Notably in one league, it led me to select a third RB before the first receiver, which ended up being Aaron Jones.  Big-time move that gave me great all-around teams.
* **James RB1nson.**  Hearing the chatter on here, especially when the Jags dropped Fournette, led me to pick him up waivers in BOTH leagues.

So thank you guys - mods, readers, shitstirrers - everyone.  2020 has been a fun ride either way, at least for fantasy.  Good luck in your ships and all!",fantasyfootball,1,1608577814,khnvyr,1

31,"Wilson owners, we haven‚Äôt seen Russ cook since week 8. As you seen from the other posts, he‚Äôs even a bottom scoring QB. Who are you trusting at QB to carry you to your win in the league championship",Aquachicken02,"As the final week approach‚Äôs, it‚Äôs evidently clear that Wilson is a no-go against the rams, even after this years biggest upset to the jets. 

It‚Äôs always said that you win off the waiver wire, so who are you trusting to bring you all the way. 

Personally, my options include Brady, Tanehill, and Hurts, and I can‚Äôt decide between the three. Mayfield is another options for most so I‚Äôll discus it too

Brady - I snagged Brady after our leagues taco dropped him for Jackson, and I imagine many of you have him on your bench after he started to look better. His lions matchup is very positive, but Brady struggles to throw those game winning deep balls, something he proved he can still do in the game winning TD to Mr. Big Chest himself. The lions may not provide a reason for these balls, and it might become a run heavy game since the lions aren‚Äôt fighting for the playoffs right now, but the floor for this match is at least 15 points

Tanehill - Next Sunday nights game is set be a shootout, with the packers looking to secure a first round bye and the Titans looking to stay ahead of the colts. Both teams are some of the highest scoring in the NFL, with stars like Adams and Henry, and great support in Jones, Brown, Davis, and Tonyan. My only two worry‚Äôs with this game is the packers defense and the fact that Tanehill was the highest scoring QB this week, something that QB‚Äôs don‚Äôt do twice in a row. With a floor of 10 in tough matchups, the ceiling for this match is even higher. Riskier than Brady with an even bigger reward.

Hurts - Now for the option everyone is looking towards, the one that seemed to be the most popular among the comments in the other thread. Simply but, two full games is not enough to determine a floor or any amount of consistency, but man his ceiling is high.  The Dallas matchup appears to be promising. A sub-par defense and as we see from this week a high scoring offense is tempting. In addition, both teams are still in the run for the playoffs, even if the odds are low. Both teams have a reason to play, and you better belief that Hurts will give it his all. His ceiling is 35 but with an untested floor, who knows what happens if he drops a stinker. 

Mayfield - Finally coming into his own, unlike Sam Darnold, the browns have developed Baker into a franchise QB, and with one more win to secure the end of a long playoff drought, Baker will give it his all. In a match of pure poetry, two QB‚Äôs from the same draft see what they could have been. One a franchise QB and the other soon to loose their job. Sam Darnold has a lot to prove, but at the end of the day he‚Äôs done. The only things that make me hesitate this matchup is the jets win against the rams and the potential for a huge lead leading to what happens last game, with lost of dump-offs at the end. Let‚Äôs face it, the floor here is 20 points, but to be honest I‚Äôm not confident in a high ceiling. 

To put it simply, Brady and Baker are the safe options, but if your really need 30+ game, go Tanehill or Hurst. What do you guys think.",fantasyfootball,1,1608576959,khnl39,1

37,Learn Python with Fantasy Football - Plotting Yards after Catch,NukishPhilosophy,"Hey everyone,

[This is part 18 of a series I've been writing for almost a year now on learning Python with fantasy football. ](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/blog/intermediate/18) 

For those who don't know, Python is a programming language that is very beginner-friendly and rapidly gaining popularity in data science / sports analytics circles. The goal of my content is meant to teach you Python through a fun and engaging topic you all enjoy, fantasy football. If you're a complete beginner to coding and this post is a bit too advanced for you, [you can check out my beginner series here.](https://www.fantasyfootballdatapros.com/blog/beginner/1)

Anyway - in this part of the series, you'll learn how to plot yards after catch distributions for the top 10 YAC receivers this season.

[Here's the data visualization you'll learn to create in this part of the series.](https://imgur.com/a/0Q1bAnc)

For those just interested in the stats, here's the YAC yardage numbers for the top 10 players this year in terms of YAC yardage:

| Player          | Yards After Catch |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Alvin Kamara    | 716               |
| Travis Kelce    | 543               |
| Devante Adams   | 535               |
| Darren Waller   | 504               |
| Cooper Kup      | 498               |
| Deandre Hopkins | 489               |
| Robert Woods    | 475               |
| Terry McLaurin  | 465               |
| JD McKissic     | 435               |

Interesting notes:

* Kamara leads the league in YAC by a healthy yardage.
* Kelce and Waller both in the top 5, and only TEs in the top 10. Both have been very valuable to have on your team, considering how much of a wasteland the TE market was this year.
* JD McKissic at 10th!
* LAR have two receivers in the top 10",fantasyfootball,1,1608574791,khmu4u,1

74,Championship week teams that could potentially sit their starters?,villagezero,"I believe the year was 2014 during week 16 of the regular season. I had made it to the finals against another manager who had Andrew Luck as his starting Qb. This was of course the year Luck almost threw 5k yards and led the league in passing TD‚Äôs. The Colts had already secured a playoff berth and were playing for the bye. After an abysmal outing against the Cowboys, the Colts decided to bench Luck in the third quarter which was the dagger for the team manager and my path to victory. 

Which teams that are out of contention (LAC, DET, for example) could possibly sit their studs and in turn have a huge impact on lineups next week?

Stafford, for example could be benched due to injury and potentially affect Hockenson‚Äôs play.

Or Keenan Allen with his ankle injury could also be benched to avoid further complications since they have nothing to play for. 

Week 16 is when starting your studs could potentially backfire.",fantasyfootball,1,1608570119,khlbcp,1

21,Championship of Disproportionate Talent,CamoFaSho,"What a year!

With all the injuries and Covid, some very strange looking teams seem to be making it to the championship round, that seem to be void of an abundance of keystone players. Maybe because these teams have 1-2 hot hand players, some lucky waiver pickups that boomed for them, or match-ups have been in their favor.

So, with that being said, what do your league final teams look like? Do they have the big hitters like Henry, Rodgers, T.Hill? Or are they a team with Todd Gurley as RB1 with Pollard at Flex? Interested to see how the talent pool panned out for your guys final teams.",fantasyfootball,1,1608559795,khi406,1

47,Poetic Justice,dsofsof,"Have you seen or experienced anything this week or recently that naturally restored order to your league?

In mine I just witnessed something great. In week 13 the first place team made a move to ensure that he played against the opposite side of the playoff tree than he otherwise would have without making the move (no reseeding).

This week after his bye week he played the opponent he basically chose to play against back in week 13, rather than letting things play out naturally. He is now going to lose this week. The other team that she would have played scored less and he would have beat them had he not altered the course of events in week 13. 

On another note, in a keeper league where value is based on round drafted -2, one guy drafted AB rd 18 this year (16 rd keeper next year). He talked shit after the draft about how good a pick it was etc. And proceeded to drop him a few weeks later. His opponent this week picked up AB a week before his reinstatement was announced and played him vs this guy this week putting up 20 points and knocking him out of playoffs.

50,Can Baker be trusted in week 16?,ThePeoplesResistance,"Let me begin by saying I'm a huge Browns fan, so my bias is clear. I'm curious what others think about playing Baker week 16 against the NY Jets. Although he started the season off miserably, he has been playing quite well recently and over the last 4 weeks has the best QBR in the league. Many teams seem to be playing against the run with the Browns and making Baker throw the ball, for which he has been very efficient. On top of this, the Jets have been giving up a great deal of points to opposing QBs. I do understand this is probably a riskier play, so what is your confidence level for him in week 16?",fantasyfootball,1,1608545973,khenaf,1

Finding a woman (or anyone for that matter) who owns her home before she is 30 is rare. Finding one who had all that and also wanted to be in a relationship with me was like a super lotto mega millions jackpot. Turns out unwise decisions in how you handle and invest in your jackpot winnings and that lottery you won is like a fucking curse hanging over your head. 


This is especially true as you realize everything is in her name,. So of course if the relationship ends, so does my current living arrangement, where I would pay rent to her in the form of a relationship. I had failed the terms of that contract and was now feeling the ramifications of that contract being terminated swiftly. 

I pulled into my moms driveway with the lights off, not wanting to wake her so late. She found me the next morning on her couch asleep wondering if she was dreaming still or already high this morning. Through tears I tell her I'm single and also homeless now and I figure I could save up for a small place with a few paychecks. 

Not 30 minutes after I clocked in I was called to HR. An hour later my termination papers were signed and now I was unemployed less than 24 hours after i became single. 

2 days later i turned 33 and ate a whole chocolate assorted variety cheesecake to myself. ""Fucking 2020, now I understand"" I mumbled aloud like I do when I secretly wonder if I'm on my own Truman Show but then I know I'm not cuz no one would watch me internally struggle over decisions and how to best.word texts and things like this reddit post. 

Rock bottom I figured. Time to rise up and come thru this better, for myself, for my ex, and my next. A week of rollercoaster days later, I found out that I was a little premature on my rock bottom statement. 

As tonight came to a close my fantasy season closed with it. Out of 4 teams, 3 had made playoffs. I was a #1, #2, and #6 seed. Last week my #2 and #6 teams lost as my #1 team clinched the top spot over the regular season. That #1 seed broke my spirit tonight, but I felt it coming earlier this week. The top spot was well earned as I put up almost 10 more points a week than anyone else and had started prepping for this 3 week stretch 4 weeks ago. Next thing I realize, it is Wednesday night and all that planning 4 weeks ago led to a bench full of IR and COVID listed players when I need them most. I salvage and maneuver with the depth I had accrued and didn't panic, trusting the instincts that got me the #1 seed. Coming away with confidence in the lineup and good about my chances this week. 

Curious to see who snuck in as the 8th seed, I stare in disbelief at my ex girlfriend's team. She hadn't checked in or made a lineup change since week 4, which might also be the week she checked out from our relationship and looked at changing her lineup at home. 

Do you ever have that feeling of impending doom? Like, fuck, they played the 5 pieces of exodia and my blue eyes are no match. And then your younger bro is banished to the shadow realm? That type of feeling? I knew she would win, I tried to change the prophecy I saw before me but in the end it was fulfilled.

I scored the second most points this week, only to see my ex's unchecked team put up the most points of the week, putting up a season high in the process. I scored 130, she put up 139. Only one other team had over 100. I made each correct lineup choice. It was inevitable, it was always going to end like this. ""Fucking 2020, now I really understand."" After thinking the worst was over, only for more unforeseen worsts to reveal themselves.

She broke up with me, left me nearly homeless, 2 days before my 33rd birthday, and the day after we broke I am fired from the job i was hoping would help me land on my feet and I was cool with all of it. But as she knocked me out of the playoffs with her unchecked team and 8seed luck, doing this in the league I run to have my friends and family and lover come together. The story was written the moment the matchup was official, my rock bottom delivered again like only the Scorpion King himself could do. Thanks to COVID I couldn't smell what he was cooking...

Will #2 get every single player from waivers or will #1 get some too?

Based on what just happened today between the Seahawks and the WFT, I'm expecting the WFT - Panthers game to be low scoring and run-heavy. This should hopefully benefit Davis.

39,Thank you üôè to all you. I made it to the final of both my leagues this year.,burner_acc55,"I am relatively new to the US (6 years) and still don‚Äôt get all of the rules of football. However, I have been participating in fantasy football past 3 years because everyone at work is and I don‚Äôt want to feel left out. 

My first year, I drafted 5 QBs because I was going purely by total points predicted lol. I also mostly drafted players with a ‚ÄòQ‚Äô next to them thinking they could play as quarterbacks too. I mixed up the rules from a different sport‚Äôs fantasy league lol. 

Long story short, in 3 years, thanks to this sub, I was able to draft better, and also manage my team better every week. I have made it to finals in both leagues. 

Unfortunately, due to pandemic there is no Christmas party at work so I can‚Äôt brag or talk shit at my coworkers this year. But very happy! 

Thank you!",fantasyfootball,1,1608519458,kh8k9e,1

I had essentially chalked my season up to a loss after a four game losing streak preceded by an incredibly strong start. Not only did I crush it this week, I beat the dominant 1 seed who was heavily favored and who I made a lot of trades with this year, most regrettably Kelce (kudos to the great Travis Kelce and his truly astonishing season). In a strange turn of events, the other semifinalist was the player I intentionally lost to last week and he won, too against the 2 seed who was also massively favored statistically! Oh how my plans were foiled, but how I rejoice now with the sweet taste of ultimate victory so near. So now it will be the 4 and 3 seeds facing off next week in the final and I hope I kick his ass into oblivion. Merry Christmas everyone!",fantasyfootball,1,1608517373,kh7za1,1

62,Mahomes' pass to Kelce should be scored as a lateral (with proof),RMiller517,"At the beginning of the 2nd quarter, against the Saints, here in week 15, Mahomes threw a 1 yard TD pass to Kelce.

A pass is determined by where the thrower let go of the ball, and the receiver caught the ball, not necessarily where their bodies where. With that info, lets look at it frame by frame from 2 angles. 

https://imgur.com/a/kRIXH2R

Top left image, you can see Mahomes foot on the 3 yard line. In the picture below it, you can see him throwing the ball from near center of his body. That means, the ball would have been released between the 2.5 and 3 yard line. 

Where Kelce catches it is tougher, but in the same bottom left photo, he starts out with his back foot almost on the 5 yard line, and front on the 4. In the next frame, on the bottom right where it is caught, his front foot doesn't move, and you can see that he's standing upright more than when he started. His body is definitely not over a full yard like when he set up. 

Also, you can see in the top right photo that he's faced with his body towards Mahomes. meaning that, although his hands are somewhat out towards the goal line, they're mostly reaching towards Mahomes to catch the ball. 

Evidence here shows that Mahomes throws it at the 2.75 yard line, and at best, Kelce catches it at the 3 yard line. Even if it were even, a sideways lateral is still considered backwards and therefore not a pass.

I can't say how much scrutiny this will come under that it is changed, but I don't see how this isn't a lateral and therefore a TD run for Kelce and not a TD throw/catch.

I genuinely like fantasy football

Months of losing the league just to have my guys take a shit in the most important game but it doesn‚Äôt matter because I missed the playoffs anyways. You constantly get hurt by smart decisions while losing to opponents that make dumb ones. The better, smarter man can lose any day of the week. You can watch hours of advanced stats, peoeple constantly saying x player will finish top 5. It's all bullshit, nobody knows what they're talking about and you have a better chance at a winning lineup by closing your eyes which I did week 12 and beat the number 1 seed. Its a 4 month long dice roll which I will definitely be participating in again next year, fuck I love maneuvering this chaos with my fellow degenerate gamblers.",fantasyfootball,1,1608485853,kgy9kq,1

26,Why WR/CB Matchups Don‚Äôt Matter for Fantasy Football - An Analysis,koolman631,"*Disclaimer: This is not OC, this is [an article](https://medium.com/the-intelligent-sports-wagerer/why-wr-cb-matchups-dont-matter-for-fantasy-football-3ff896da3c04) by Jake Tribbey that I found interesting and wanted to share. It‚Äôs a good, informative ~5-10 min read but if you want a TL;DR just skip to the last sentence. 

You see them everywhere. Anybody who has spent time researching what‚Äôs impactful for fantasy football has stumbled upon a matchup chart or two. Intrinsically, it makes sense that a Wide Receiver‚Äôs fantasy output would be impacted by the man covering him, Football is a game of inches after all.

However, in this article, I am proposing something radical. I am proposing we throw 99% of fantasy football coverage matchup advice out the window. While that may sound harsh, I will do my best to explain this stance with as much evidence as possible. I‚Äôll go over coverage types, how coverage types interact with WR routes, the volatility of coverage, how that applies to fantasy football, why matchup charts/advice are so popular in the fantasy football community, and where actionable coverage/matchup advice can be found.

**The Types of Coverage**

Most casual football fans have heard the terms ‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòzone‚Äô coverage, but very few understand how complex coverage is at the NFL level. Let‚Äôs start with some basics.
Cover 0, Cover 1, and Cover 2-Man are the base versions of what, for the purposes of this article, we will call ‚ÄòMan coverage‚Äô. The number in each coverage indicates how many players will be playing a deep-safety role, with 2 deep safeties in Cover-2 and no deep defenders in Cover-0. Man coverages require most of their coverage defenders to cover their assigned receiver step for step, mano-a-mano.

Zone coverages are made up of Cover 2, Cover 3, Cover 4 (aka ‚Äòquarters‚Äô), and Cover 6. Just like man coverage, the number at the end of the coverage reveals how many deep players there are. The key exception being Cover 6, which is one-half Cover 2 and one-half Cover 4. Zone coverages require their players to first get to a spot on the field, known as a zone, and then cover whatever receiver runs into that zone. Sounding a lot like Madden, right? How complicated can it really be?

NFL offensive coordinators are actually pretty smart guys, and they developed counters to every major coverage I just mentioned. Defensive coaches were then forced to develop counters to those counters, leading to a Darwinian progression of coverage techniques and variations.

At the professional level what we are left with is, quite literally, thousands of versions of what Nick Saban coined: ‚ÄòMatch Coverage‚Äô. Match coverage relies on defensive players to read offensive route combinations and react to cover receivers man-to-man based on the rules of the called match coverage. This essentially combines the head-to-head coverage element of man defenses with the eyes on the QB, read and react nature of zone coverage.

For example, the base version of Cover 4 offers four deep defenders, who split the deep parts of the field into ‚Äòquarters‚Äô and three underneath players, who focus on routes run within the first ten or so yards of the line of scrimmage. With so many players focused on defending deep, offenses attack underneath with quick slants, various screens, and other short route combinations.

To stop the offense from putting up video game numbers on underneath throws, the defense develops rules based on the underneath concepts the offense runs. One rule could be that the outside corner will cover the outside receiver man-to-man unless the #2 receiver on that side runs an out route in the first five yards, in which case that corner passes off the outside WR and plays #2 man-to-man. Another rule could be that the outside corner is man-to-man with the outside WR, unless the WR runs a shallow, inside breaking route, in which case the corner gives an ‚Äòunder‚Äô call, passes off that WR and plays his deep 1/4. Now imagine thousands of combinations of those rules intertwined with the base coverages already mentioned, constituting dozens or hundreds of play calls, all completely dependent on what the offense runs.

**How Does This Relate to Fantasy Football?**

I give that overarching rundown on coverage to assist you, the reader, in understanding that breaking down WR and DB play at the NFL level requires tremendous nuance and is never as simple as ‚Äúthis bad CB is projected to line up across from that WR so that WR has an amazing matchup.‚Äù

Great strides in fantasy football data science could be made if advanced coverage data were publically available, but unless you work for the right people, you won‚Äôt have access to that gold mine. That‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you hear fantasy football analysts discuss coverage matchups, as very few have access to data that would help them make any meaningful conclusions.

**What about the teams that play man coverage?**

While college, and especially high school football offer teams that run just a few schemes and keep things quite simple, the NFL is a copy-cat league. The latest trend: mixing up your coverage.

This article from SportsInfoSolutions (one of the few companies that collect advanced coverage data) and this one from PFF showcase that the most man-heavy teams in the NFL play man coverage on just over 50% of their snaps. That leaves a lot of room for variation, in both one-on-one matchups and play calls.

So organizations that analysts tout as being ‚Äòman teams‚Äô play zone on nearly half their snaps. See the problem?

Even if we were to give this argument the benefit of the doubt and assume an NFL team would actually play man coverage on every snap, offenses know how to beat it. Here is an excellent breakdown from 9-year NFL veteran CB Darius Butler on how NFL teams attack man coverage with bunch formations and what defenses can do to counter. It‚Äôs a 25-minute video about a single way offenses attack man coverage. When factoring in motion, stack releases, and picks/rubs you can clearly see that NFL offenses have a litany of tools to beat man coverage.

Regardless of what your favorite matchup chart says, the WR you are targeting isn‚Äôt going to line up across from the Packers‚Äô worst corner all game, or even the majority of snaps.

**What about ‚ÄòShadow‚Äô matchups?**

Based on my tone so far, this is probably the part you expect me to say something like ‚Äòshadow matchups aren‚Äôt real‚Äô and move on. Don‚Äôt worry, they are real. They just don‚Äôt happen as often as most fantasy players likely believe.

Looking at PFF‚Äôs quite useful Shadow Coverage Matrix, we see that about 15‚Äì30% of teams will utilize a shadow corner in a given week. However, while most would believe a ‚Äòshadow‚Äô matchup requires that a corner covers a WR on 100% of his routes, the PFF Shadow Matrix data suggests otherwise.
In fact, in the first 12 weeks of 2020, there have been just under 200 games played and just 26 instances of a corner lining up across from a WR on more than 80% of the WRs‚Äô routes.

The chart description itself states, ‚Äú A corner is considered to be shadowing them if they lined up across from that receiver on over 50% of their routes from both the left and right. Percentage of routes includes the slot. All receiving stats are on plays the corner lined up against the receiver, regardless of who ended up being the person covering the receiver at the time of the pass.‚Äù

Even football‚Äôs most reputable stat provider doesn‚Äôt offer primary coverage defender data, just alignment data, as a fantasy football tool. This demonstrates how difficult it is to truly discern what is and is not a ‚Äòshadow matchup‚Äô.

**The Volatility of Coverage**

Remember when A.J. Bouye was an All-Pro corner? If you are unaware, he still plays professional football for the Denver Broncos, so why hasn‚Äôt Bouye‚Äôs name been thrown around much in 2020 as a top corner? No, it‚Äôs not because he was recently suspended for PEDs. It‚Äôs because game-to-game, and especially year-to-year, coverage is tremendously volatile.

While not directly related to fantasy football, Estimated Points Added (EPA) has been long-used in analytic circles as a strong measure of player performance on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball.

Right alongside PFF coverage grades, EPA is one of the best measures of how much value a coverage defender adds on a per-game basis. According to this 2018 article from PFF on the value of coverage and receiving, ‚Äúit‚Äôs important to note that this comes with the results we‚Äôve written today ‚Äî that coverage from various positions (at least how we‚Äôve measured them ‚Äî through PFF grades and EPA) are not as stable season-to-season as other traits (receiving stability) we‚Äôve explored.‚Äù

Looking at PFF coverage grades from 2018 to 2019, we see a mere 0.29 correlation coefficient for CBs, demonstrating the past successful coverage performances cannot be relied on to predict future coverage success. Coverage stats like passer rating allowed don‚Äôt help much either, with a 0.08 correlation coefficient from 2018 to 2019 for NFL corners.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, EPA, PFF Coverage Grades, and passer rating allowed are great stats to determine how well a coverage player has played, but these statistics are not predictive of future performance, despite many fantasy analysts suggesting they are.

**The Popularity of Matchup Charts and Analysis**

I‚Äôm a sucker for nuanced football analysis, and I would suppose most of the people reading this are as well. While there are certainly people who know what they are talking about when it comes to coverage, I‚Äôll mention them later. The real reason you‚Äôre here is that you saw a tweet (Buster Skrine vs. Davante Adams *fire emoji* fire emoji* *fire emoji*), read a post, or saw a matchup chart that screamed at you to put a certain player into your lineup because he was facing a bad corner and he failed.

Hopefully, with a more in-depth understanding of how complicated coverage is, you can see why that matchup chart didn‚Äôt win you that semi-final game in your friends and family league.

Why do analysts tout matchups all the time?
It sells. As a low-tier tout myself, I‚Äôm well aware of how difficult it can be to develop reasons for why you like certain players every week. CB/WR matchups inherently make sense to most fans and seem like they should significantly impact fantasy scoring.

With virtually every fantasy football content website providing subscription-based services, large amounts of content need to be published weekly to keep people coming back. Matchup charts and analysis make for the perfect weekly article.

Fantasy Football players, myself included, love conditional formatting. It makes every chart look better visually and when it‚Äôs combined with a concept that naturally makes sense to most football fans, it‚Äôs easy to see how this content became popular.

I don‚Äôt blame touts for promoting this kind of analysis. Their job is to provide consistent, weekly content. However, I do think they are taking advantage of a knowledge gap in their consumer base, and many touts do not have a high enough understanding of coverage concepts to fill this gap. This brings us to our final discussion:

Where can I find Coverage and Matchup data that will help me with Fantasy Football?
Now that we are acutely aware of the downfalls of traditional WR/CB matchup analysis, we can finally focus on what matters ‚Äî winning fantasy football games.

With teams rarely shadowing and many coverage concepts requiring that defenders pass off or ‚Äòswitch‚Äô the offensive player they are covering, we can largely throw most individual WR/CB matchup analysis out the window. However, coverage analysis at the team level can still be worthwhile.

Stats like FootballOutsiders DVOA, PFF Coverage Grades, and defensive EPA allowed on passing plays are an excellent way for fantasy players to quickly determine the overall strength of a pass defense. It‚Äôs important to remember that WRs aren‚Äôt just playing against the CB lined up across from them, they are facing an entire coverage unit that has to work together and communicate to slow down the offense.

By attacking the weakest overall pass defenses and avoiding the strongest overall pass defenses, fantasy players can realize an albeit small, but meaningful edge when it comes to pass game matchups.
What touts actually know what they are talking about when it comes to coverage?
I‚Äôve read most of the coverage/matchup articles that are regularly published, and one in particular sticks out every week: Wes Huber‚Äôs NFL Advanced Matchups column. I‚Äôve linked his most recent piece from Week 15 here.

Wes Huber is a former PFF coverage analyst who now works for fantasypoints.com, one of the best DFS tout sites out there. As someone who‚Äôs been through PFF‚Äôs process of learning the complexity of coverage and how to chart it, I can vouch that Wes knows his stuff when it comes to coverage. He even goes through every play of every game, every week to make sure he has the most accurate possible coverage data, something that‚Äôs extremely time-consuming but assures the quality of his work.

Fantasy players determined to exploit edges in coverage matchups should view Wes as their savior, as the length and depth of his weekly NFL Advanced Matchups column are unmatched anywhere else in the industry. He‚Äôs great at what he does and deserves more credit in the community.

Those looking to broaden their overall understanding of coverage concepts should start with The Pass Coverage Glossary by Cameron Soran. While this may not directly relate to fantasy football, it is an excellent guide as to the many variations of coverage, what certain schemes are designed to stop, and it includes helpful diagrams for the more visual learners out there. Essentially a coverage encyclopedia, you won‚Äôt find a more detailed 30,000-foot view of coverage concepts anywhere else out there.

Last but certainly not least, former NFL CB Darius Butler runs an excellent Youtube channel called Everything DB, where he breaks down advanced coverage concepts and techniques at the NFL and college levels. I know, it‚Äôs not fantasy football related, but watching just a couple of his videos demonstrates what I‚Äôve tried to put into writing in this piece: NFL coverage is extremely complicated and is almost never a pure 1 v 1 matchup.",fantasyfootball,1,1608483712,kgxks6,1
